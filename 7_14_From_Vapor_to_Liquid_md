<h1 id="update-your-landing-page-from-vapor-to-liquid">Update your landing page from Vapor to Liquid</h1>
<p><em>Method</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Use your Listen &amp; Learn experience to define a few key benefits your product provides to your market.</li>
<li>Use those benefits to update your  <em>Vapor</em>  landing page to  <em>Liquid</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Look back at  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/stage/5/step/6">Stage 5: Learn what to include on your landing page</a>  for a sample  <em>Liquid</em>  landing page.</p>
<p>The key difference between  <em>Vapor</em>  and  <em>Liquid</em>  is that  <em>Liquid</em>  includes  <strong>feature bullets</strong>, phrased as benefits to our customers.</p>
<p>Now may also be a good time to consider revisions to the existing elements of our page: our brand/logo, headline, and subheadline.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em></p>
<p>If you used a Beta community as a way to grow your seed group, you may have already completed this action. Great! But take some time now to revise your website based on the feedback you’ve received from your Super Seeds.</p>
<p>Congrats on graduating up from the <em>Vapor</em> to the <em>Liquid</em> phase! But just because you’ve had some positive validation experiences doesn’t mean you are “done” with Listening &amp; Learning. There’s a reason this stage is <em>Liquid</em>, not <em>Solid</em>. Continue to gather feedback and revise your idea, and your website, as needed over the course of Stage 8. Then in Stage 9, you’ll be ready to go <em>Solid</em>!</p>
