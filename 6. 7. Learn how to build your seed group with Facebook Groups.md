<p>Facebook Groups are an excellent way to grow your seed group.</p>
<p>Academy members  <a href="https://nugget.one/@phil">@Phil</a>  and  <a href="https://nugget.one/@johngarcia">@Johngarcia</a>  have each written step-by-step guides to show us how they effectively used Facebook Groups to grow their list.</p>
<p>Hands on training doesn‚Äôt get better than this!</p>

<h4 id="strategy-1-use-surveys-to-grow-your-seed-group-highly-recommended">Strategy #1: Use Surveys to Grow Your Seed Group (Highly Recommended)</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://nugget.one/@phil">@Phil</a></strong>  created this genius strategy to grow his Seed Group for  <strong><a href="https://andiapp.co/">Andi</a></strong>  (Digital Poker Assistant).</p>
<p><strong><em>This is my new #1 favorite method to grow a Seed Group.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step #1: Find some Facebook Groups for your target market</strong></p>
<p>Search for your target market on Facebook or Google. When searching Google use a search like ‚Äú<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+parent+groups">faceboook parent groups</a>‚Äù</p>
<p>There are hundreds of groups for anything you can imagine, so you can afford to be specific. Join a few - look for the ones with the largest amount of members.</p>
<p>Most of them will screen new applicants with some basic questions- answer honestly. You‚Äôll usually be accepted within 1-2 days.</p>
<p><strong>Step #2: Post a simple survey into your selected groups</strong></p>
<p>The survey should be just one question asking your audience if they would use your idea/product, with a brief example of how it would work. Just offer yes/no response options.</p>
<p>This is the survey I posted for Andi:</p>
<p>Would you use a mobile app that could give you a retrospective GTO review of your hand? i.e. you provide it with much the same details as the hands posted on here, as well as villains perceived range. Then it tells you the most optimal play for each decision point.</p>
<p>üîòYes! Where can I get this?</p>
<p>üîòNo. I prefer to get hand reviews from other players.</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>Don‚Äôt mention you are thinking of building it, and don‚Äôt include the landing page at this point. Most group admins are looking out for spam, and posts that appear commercial will often get removed. Although you may get some clicks, you won‚Äôt get a chance to have a real impact.</p>
<p>Facebook provides options for checkbox answers, so just offer a Yes/No choice. Creating the poll is pretty self-explanatory, but check out  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/175694272486085/">this how-to</a>  for steps.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt give people the chance to be indifferent, as they will often take it. We‚Äôre looking to polarise the market here. ‚ÄúMaybes‚Äù are no good at this point; we want strong ‚Äúyes‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Step #3: Post your survey</strong></p>
<p>When you‚Äôre satisfied with your Survey, post it and wait for the results.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on it and like/respond positively to any comments people make. Don‚Äôt worry too much about what they‚Äôre saying. The activity will help to keep you in people‚Äôs news feeds.</p>
<p>In my experience, people are going to be cynical and try and tell you how ‚Äúit won‚Äôt work,‚Äù ‚Äúeasier said than done,‚Äù etc.</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>Try not to engage in a back and forth with them. Just agree that it would be challenging and direct them back to answering the actual question.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a screenshot of my survey with responses:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/fb-example-3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Step #4: Reply to respondents</strong></p>
<p>The good news is  <strong><em>Facebook lets you see exactly who answers your survey.</em></strong>  Using this info, you can personally outreach to each respondent‚Ä¶ this is the magic.</p>
<p>Here is an example response message:</p>
<p><em>Hi {name goes here},<br>
You selected an answer in a survey in the {name of the group goes here} facebook group, on {your idea goes here}. Because you chose ‚Äú{yes answer goes here},‚Äù I wanted to reach out to you. I hope you don‚Äôt mind. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not trying to sell you anything.<br>
I‚Äôm looking for advice from {your market goes here}. I have an initial idea: {your idea goes here}, and I want to refine it. I want to make something that you would want to use.<br>
If you‚Äôre interested in helping out, please check out our landing page: {your landing page goes here} and subscribe to our mailing list (don‚Äôt worry, I wont be sending you loads of spam, it‚Äôs really just a way to keep track of numbers at the moment). We also have a slack group set up that you can join via the mailing list. I would love to catch up with you there sometime.<br>
However, if you‚Äôre not interested, apologies for bothering you and thanks for your valuable input.</em></p>
<p>Make sure you show your appreciation for their response, and don‚Äôt oversell it. We can only show them the door, they have to walk through it.</p>
<p>After about 24 hours, you‚Äôll probably have reached all the people that are going to respond to your survey. Expect a relatively low click rate - from a group of over 10,000 members, I got about 70 responses.</p>
<p>Send your response message to each  <em>Yes</em>  person.</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>Don‚Äôt send a group message. You want your message to be personal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Make sure you stagger your messages</em></strong>, or just stop once you start seeing warnings. Again, don‚Äôt expect miracles here. Out of 50 messages sent, I got about 8 email addresses and 4 Slack subscribers.</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>The Facebook poll idea was a true group effort. It was based on an idea by Phil‚Äôs friend  <a href="https://nugget.one/@habibalamin">@habibalamin</a>. He originally created a Poll for Twitter.</p>
<h4 id="use-discussion-to-grow-your-seed-group-recommended">Use Discussion to Grow Your Seed Group (Recommended)</h4>
<p><strong><a href="https://nugget.one/@johngarcia">@Johngarcia</a></strong>  used this method to effectively grow his Seed Group for  <strong><a href="https://www.quilt.one/">Quilt</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Another excellent method. This one relies a bit on luck of the draw in terms of what conversations naturally pop up in your groups, but if you keep an eye out, you could strike gold. Here‚Äôs what  <strong><a href="https://nugget.one/@johngarcia">@Johngarcia</a></strong>  did:</p>
<p><strong>Step #1:</strong>  Searched Google for  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+quilting+group">Facebook Quilting Group</a></p>
<p><strong>Step #2:</strong>  Joined the highest membership quilting Facebook Group (128k members)</p>
<p><strong>Step #3:</strong>  READ ALL THE RULES. They had self-promotion clauses and would delete posts/ban members breaking those rules.</p>
<p><strong>Step #4:</strong>  Posted in the ‚Äústicky self-promotion‚Äù thread with a link to my landing page - this wasn‚Äôt as successful.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong>  Monitored the conversation (90% of my news feed was quilting at this point) until software was mentioned. There was a post asking for recommendations:</p>

<p><strong>Step #6:</strong>  And my response:</p>
<p>Screen Shot</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/fb-example-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This conversation hit the nail on the head. Keep in mind that the request for a software solution may not come up in all groups, but it‚Äôs worth keeping an eye out for, and contributing to other discussions can be a natural way to make connections and gain seeds as well.</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>If you come up with any more Facebook tricks, let me know and I‚Äôll add them to this lesson.</p>
