<ul>
<li>What were the challenges of growing your seed group? What strategies worked, and were they the original ones you tried or did you have to change course?</li>
<li>What was the most interesting feedback you received from your seed group?</li>
<li>Are you moving forward with your original idea, or did you validate several?</li>
<li>Do you have any mockups to share with the cohort?</li>
<li>Would you like to share your revised  <em>Liquid</em>  landing page? Do you have feedback on any of the other landing pages shared here?</li>
<li>How has it been going with checking in on your Project Page?</li>
<li>What are you excited about or nervous about as you enter Stages 8 and beyond?</li>
