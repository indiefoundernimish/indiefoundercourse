<li>Axe ideas that are blocked by competition using the hints below.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Remember the facets by which we can determine when competition matters and when it doesn’t:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your revenue goal</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your market size</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your price points</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, get ready to do some analysis! Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify your monthly revenue goal. Be realistic - not too extravagant but not too humble. Let’s call that  <strong><em>R</em></strong>  for  <strong><em>revenue</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Take another look at your list. Identify the market for each of your ideas, and guestimate (do some quick google searches if needed) the market size. Let’s call that  <strong><em>M</em></strong>  for  <strong><em>market</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Try to identify a reasonable price point at which you could sell the product into that market. Sneak a peek at some competitors’ pricing to give you an idea if needed. And let’s call that  <strong><em>P</em></strong>  for  <strong><em>price</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Divide your monthly revenue goal by your monthly price point to calculate how many paying customers you’d need to reach your goal. If we think of  <strong><em>C</em></strong>  as  <strong><em>customers</em></strong>, that formula is  <strong><em>R/P=C</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Compare your needed customers to the overall market and determine the percentage of the market you’d need to sign up for or convert to your product. This percentage is your customers divided by the market, times 100. So,  <strong><em>C/M x 100</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Now, identify competitors for your idea. Jot them down if you already know them, or do some quick research.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s not a science, but look at your list again with this new information. Determine how confident you feel in your ability to acquire the percentage of the market that you identified in step 5, factoring in the percentage that is already signed up with, or likely to sign up with, the competitors identified in step 6.</p>
<p>Is there room in the market for your idea? Or is the space too saturated with options you’d be unable to compete with?</p>
<p>Time to make some more cuts. Based on your analysis, cross off any ideas from your list that are likely to be stamped out by the competition. This could include crossing out all ideas under certain markets that are already too saturated or that are unable to support your desired revenue goals.</p>
