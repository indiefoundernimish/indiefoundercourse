<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>Identify all ideas that scored a 5 with the product/founder fit algorithm, and pick your top three favorites!</p>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>It’s decision time.</p>
<p>If you don’t have three ideas with a score of 5, take another look at your ideas with a score of 4. Instead of trying to change the score, is there a way you could change the idea? Consider how it might be adapted to serve different markets or customers. Think about how the product itself could be delivered in different ways. Ask yourself if it could be narrowed down to a smaller snowball for an initial offering.</p>
<p>If you’re still at a loss and can’t find a score-of-5 idea, don’t worry. Instead, focus on the Market component. Select three ideas for the market(s) you’re most excited to work with, and don’t get too hung up on the details. It could be that talking directly to that market could lead you to a better idea than anything you’ve thought of yet.</p>
<p><em>Of course, remember you can reach out to Justin or Nimish on Discord for help! And if you’re not completely excited or sure about these top three ideas, don’t worry. Stages 5-7 will ensure that when you start building, you’ll be building a product that is an excellent fit not only for you, but also for your customers.</em></p>
<p><em>Final Sanity Check</em></p>
<p>I have added this final sanity check to make sure that  <strong><em>only viable ideas get past this point.</em></strong>  If any of your top ideas don’t pass this sanity check, then you’ll need to go back and work up new ones that can.</p>
<p><strong>Each one of your top three idea picks MUST:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Be something you can launch a bare bones version of within 3 months or less</li>
<li>Only solve one single specific problem</li>
<li>Serve a niche or market you have an affinity with</li>
<li>Support the price point and market size you need</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Each idea becomes IMMEASURABLY easier if it ticks one (or more) of these boxes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solves a huge pain point for the customer</li>
<li>Helps the customer make more money</li>
<li>Helps the customer be better at their job</li>
<li>Helps the customer live a better life</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have discarded any ideas that tick these boxes it might be worth re-considering them.</p>
