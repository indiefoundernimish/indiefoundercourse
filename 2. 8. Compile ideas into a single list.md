<p>Copy all of your product ideas into a single list.</p>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Congratulations - this is the last action of Stage 2!</p>
<p>You’ll want to enter Stage 3 with a nice long list of product ideas, so take a few extra minutes now to look back at your earlier actions, and copy all of your product ideas into a single list.</p>
<p>While you’re organizing your list, pay attention to the markets your ideas serve. Are there any common trends? Could some ideas be tweaked to apply to specific markets you’re interested? Keep this aspect of the list in mind and consider noting the market for each idea as you pull your full list together.</p>
<p>If you think your overall list of ideas is on the short side (less than 30), be sure to generate a few more using any of the methods you’ve explored, or just good old brainstorming.</p>
