<p>You’ve got your page set up to capture those seed group leads.</p>
<p>Take some time now to share your page on Discord and give &amp; get some feedback. When looking at other founders’ pages, use the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there elements of the other pages that you really like?</li>
<li>Are there any pages that appear to have tech or display issues?</li>
<li>Do you have any suggestions that might improve the other pages?</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S. Are you wondering what to do with those people who sign up to your mailing list? Good! That’s what Stages 6 &amp; 7 are all about!</p>
<p>Reminder to mark the other lessons and actions in this stage as complete. Then, when you mark this final discussion as complete, you’ll be unlocking Stages 6.</p>
