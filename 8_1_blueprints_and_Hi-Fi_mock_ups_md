<p>It’s time to take action!</p>
<p>While the actual “build” of your product will take place in Stage 12, you can consider Stage 8 the beginning of that build.</p>
<p>In this stage, we’ll explore how to take our insights from the Listen &amp; Learn Loop and evolve those insights into a fully-defined product, ready to be built!</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Your concept of the product may continue to grow throughout this stage and beyond - that’s ok! It’s important to develop an understanding of the initial product specs in this stage, but that doesn’t mean things are set in stone. You should continue to Listen &amp; Learn throughout the remaining stages, and long after your launch!</p>
