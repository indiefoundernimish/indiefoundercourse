<h3 id="about-stage-6">About Stage 6</h3>
<p>We decided to make this stage all learning because the next stage  <em>Stage 7: Listen &amp; Learn</em>  relies on you knowing this information up front.</p>
<p>With that in mind, in the next step I’ll explain what a Seed Group is and why it is important.</p>
<p>Then, in steps 3-7 I’ll explain multiple strategies and methods you can used to grow your Seed Group.</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Different product ideas work better with different Seed Group growth strategies. If a method is suited to a particular product type I’ll note it in the lesson.</p>
