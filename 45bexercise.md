<h1 id="discuss-your-three-worked-up-ideas-in-discord">Discuss your three worked up ideas in Discord</h1>
<p>It’s as simple as that. Share your lean canvases, or at the very least, your key takeaways from creating those lean canvases, in Discord!</p>
<p>Consider the following questions as you discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the common elements between your three ideas? Are they all solving a similar problem? Serving similar customers? Etc.</li>
<li>What was the hardest part about completing the lean canvases?</li>
<li>Do you have a clear favorite? If so, why?</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to sharing the lean canvases, use this discussion to both give and get feedback on product/founder fit in general or any other concepts touched on in this stage. There’s just one more action, and you’ll be on to Stage 5!</p>
