<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pick a tool or language to create your  <em>Vapor</em>  landing page.</li>
<li>Write down your pick in the action response box at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We’re only deciding what to use here. The actual building of your landing page happens in the next step.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about making a backend, all we need is a static page at this point.</li>
<li>This is a lesson masquerading as an action!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>For Coders</p>
<p>If you are a coder then you’ll probably want to build your own landing page using tools and frameworks you are familiar with.</p>
<p>For the lazy coder, I’ve included source code for a pre-built  <em>Vapor</em>  landing page (see below).</p>
<p>It’s 100% custom, so if you want to use bootstrap or another framework, you’ll need to build from the ground up.</p>
<p>For Non-Coders</p>
<p>You can do this too! There are lots of very easy-to-use landing page creators and website builders ready for the job.</p>
<p>Since landing page builders are  <em>specifically</em>  setup for what we’re doing here, you might find them faster than full website builders. Have a look through all the options I’ve listed below and try out the ones that appeal to you.</p>
<p>Of course, feel free to use any platforms you are already familiar with! The ones listed below just provide a few options.</p>
<p>For Coders &amp; Non-Coders</p>
<p>Whatever option you pick, take some time now to explore it, get to know it, and make sure you like it. You could use almost anything to create the type of simple landing page we’re building here, but you might want to stick with the same tool to build a fuller site in the future (Stage 9).</p>
<p>If you realize after playing for a while that you don’t love your first choice, go back to the options and try a different one.</p>
<p><strong><em>And don’t get hung up on the page content just yet. That’s what the next lesson and action are all about!</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="for-coders--ready-to-go">For Coders / Ready to Go</h4>
<p>For a cheat option, I coded up a  <em>Vapor</em>  landing page (“happy” brand). You are free to use it as a base for your own landing page source code.</p>
<p>To Download a “Ready to Go” Landing Page</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://nugget.one/downloads/landing-pages/vapor.html">Open the page here</a></li>
<li>Right click  <em>View Page Source</em></li>
<li>Right click  <em>Save As</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need a  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=web+hosting">web hosting account</a>  to host the page.</li>
<li>You can change the fonts to anything you find on  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>  by editing the include (at the top) and the font family (first part of the style sheet).</li>
<li>The logo text is using Google fonts directly (i.e not an image)</li>
<li>The logo image is an .svg exported directly from  <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/">Flaticon</a>.</li>
