<h1 id="axe-ideas-that-arent-a-good-product-type-for-you">Axe ideas that aren’t a good product type for you</h1>
<p><em>If you have any questions about this action, ask us in Discord, we will answer there and add to an FAQ here.</em></p>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take another look at your list of ideas, and if you haven’t already done so, identify the product types that fit with each idea.</li>
<li>For each product type, think through the possible unique pros and cons for  <em>you</em>  personally.</li>
<li>Axe ideas with a product type that will make it too difficult for you to succeed with your current resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>When considering each product type, try thinking about it  <em>subjectively</em>. The previous lesson laid out some fairly  <em>objective</em>  pros and cons, but it’s  <em>you</em>  that will be building the product, so think about what will work for  <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure what type of product you might build for some ideas or markets, but you’re still interested in exploring them, leave them on the list. If they have real potential and they make it through the list-narrowing process of this stage, they could be worth exploring further.</p>
