<h1 id="connect-your-email-list-to-your-landing-page">Connect your email list to your landing page</h1>
<p><em>If you have any questions about this action, ask us in Discord, we will answer there and add to an FAQ here.</em></p>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wire up your list to your landing page.</li>
<li>Type “It works!” in the action response box when it’s all wired up and tested!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not create a drip welcome message at this point. We will get to that in Stage 7.</li>
<li>Make sure to turn off double opt-in. Be sure to test that new signups get onto your list without needing to click a confirmation link. At this early stage we need the highest conversion rate possible since we are dealing with so few people.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>You’re almost done! Once you’ve got your mailing list all plugged in, you’ll be ready to start collecting some contacts that could become part of your seed group - the focus of Stage 6.</p>
<p>Use the previous lesson as a guide, and get set up!</p>
<p>Be sure to test that everything is running smoothly by visiting your page and entering some fake emails from multiple browsers and devices. Check for display issues while you’re at it.</p>
<p>Just because things are looking good on your device in your browser of choice doesn’t mean it will look that way for everyone!</p>
<p>Try it from your phone. Try it from a friend’s laptop. Try it at different browser window sizes.</p>
<p>FYI If you want to use Drip</p>

<p>We just want to be sure there are no techy barriers preventing potential future customers from adding their emails to that list!</p>
