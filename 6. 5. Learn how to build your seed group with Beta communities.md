<h4 id="beta-community-strategy">Beta Community Strategy</h4>
<p>It is possible to submit your landing page as a pre-release product with only a “join waitlist” button to some beta communities.</p>
<p>This strategy will only work if your product idea is an  <em>interesting</em>  idea that will appeal to a  <em>general</em>  audience.</p>

<p>The betalist growth strategy is simple. Here it is:</p>
<p><strong>Step #1:</strong>  Create a landing page that has an appealing mass market idea.</p>
<p><strong>Step #2:</strong>  Submit it to a beta community.</p>
<p>I have some experience with this method and I really like it. I’ve listed two personal examples below.</p>
<h4 id="betalist-example-1-spoke">BetaList Example #1: Spoke</h4>
<p>I used  <a href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a>  to build a seed group for an idea I had called  <a href="https://betalist.com/startups/spoke">Spoke</a>.</p>
<p>Outcome</p>
<ul>
<li>It cost $99 to get it to the front of the queue (or wait 3 months)</li>
<li>I got over 300 people to signup to my mailing list.</li>
<li>Based on customer discussions, the idea  <em>was</em>  validated.</li>
<li>I decided to drop the project because, based on talking to potential customers, I learned that the technology could not deliver on their expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/spoke.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="betalist-example-2-gitguard">BetaList Example #2: GitGuard</h4>
<p>I used  <a href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a>  to build a seed group for an idea I had called  <a href="https://betalist.com/startups/git-guard">GitGuard</a>.</p>
<p>Outcome</p>
<ul>
<li>It cost $99 to get it to the front of the queue (or wait 3 months).</li>
<li>I got over 25 people to signup to my mailing list.</li>
<li>Based on customer discussions, the idea  <em>was not</em>  validated.</li>
<li>I quickly dropped the idea.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/gitguard.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Notice how important validation was in both of the above examples. I could have spent months building these products, only to find out that they wouldn’t have given the people what they want.</p>
<p>With regard to GuitGuard in particular: It was a  <em>surprisingly</em>  satisfying feeling for this idea to be verified as a utterly crap so quickly. It was a pleasure to axe it!</p>
