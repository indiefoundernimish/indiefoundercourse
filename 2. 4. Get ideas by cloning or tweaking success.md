<p>Cloning and tweaking success is, by far, the most common way businesses come to life across the globe.</p>
<p>How It Works</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Someone with an original vision creates a product or service.</li>
<li>The service becomes successful and starts to generate good revenue.</li>
<li>The market is now validated.</li>
<li>Other entrepreneurs join in the good times with their own offerings.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not confined to the tech sector - it happens everywhere!</p>
<p>Examples of “Clone and Tweak Success” Businesses</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Being an independent consultant</li>
<li>Opening a real estate office</li>
<li>Making iPhone accessories</li>
<li>Opening a Cafe</li>
</ul>
<p>The main point is to  <strong><em>clone and tweak a business that has already been validated</em></strong>. This takes a  <em>huge</em>  amount of risk off the table.</p>
<p>Key Benefits of Cloning and Tweaking Success</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Starting a business that is already validated massively reduces risk.</li>
<li>Studying an existing business to “see how they did it” allows you to replicate or even improve on a proven success.</li>
<li>The hard work of finding an idea and validating a market is done for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Important Note</p>
<hr>
<p>Cloning and tweaking success is very different to cloning and tweaking  <em>a good idea</em>.</p>
<p>For the strategy to work, you must  <strong><em>clone a business that is making money</em></strong>.</p>
<p>In other words, if you see a great new idea launched on Product Hunt, it is not a good candidate for cloning because they most likely haven’t proven their business model yet.</p>
<h1 id="ethics--pride">Ethics &amp; Pride</h1>
<p>Many entrepreneurs don’t like the idea of cloning and tweaking success because they object to it on ethical or prideful grounds. Let’s deal with each of those objections.</p>
<p>Objection #1: “It’s wrong to clone a business because that’s stealing”</p>
<hr>
<p>As discussed in Stage 1,  <em>First Mover Advantage</em>  is a myth. As a result, the vast majority of businesses are not original, whether they were cloned or not. Thinking of all of these businesses as “stolen” would mean the majority of entrepreneurs out there are thieves.</p>
<p>So, then, why not be purposeful about it?</p>
<p>Instead of hoping for the best, why not pick a pre-existing business/market that we  <em>know</em>  is already making money?</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that we will be the new competition that kills another business. Odds are, the original business will continue to operate just fine.  <strong><em>Yet they will always have competition, with or without us</em></strong>.</p>
<p>For example, at Nugget we’ve received over 5 nugget submissions from people suggesting dog walking software. Each of those people think they submitted a new idea that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>In reality there are already more than  <a href="https://www.capterra.com/pet-sitting-software/">19 SaaS dog walking platforms</a>!</p>
<p>Objection #2: “I want to think up my own, idea not copy another”</p>
<hr>
<p>Personally, this objection resonates with me strongly. Somehow I feel like there would be some kind of slight on my ego if I were not to come up with the idea myself.</p>
<p>But, when I think about it logically, I can see this is not a strong position to hold. By far, the “logical” thing to do would be to clone and tweak a sucessfull business in order to mitigate as much risk as possible up front.</p>
<p>Additionally, “tweak” is a key word here. Just because we start out with a cloned business doesn’t mean it stays that way.</p>
<p><strong><em>As soon as we get real customers, we can learn from them and start iterating towards a more original differentiated product.</em></strong></p>
<p>Which is great! Because having a differentiated product in a sucessfull market is simply good business.</p>
<p>In other words, even if you start out from a clone, you will most likely end up with an original differentiated businesses.</p>

<h1 id="picking-a-business-to-clone--tweak">Picking a Business to Clone &amp; Tweak</h1>
<p><strong><em>This strategy only works if we pick the right type of business to clone</em></strong>. Simply picking  <em>any ol’ sucessfull business</em>  will not guarantee success.</p>
<p>For example, Google and Apple are sucessfull businesses. Should we try to clone them? Of course not! They are way too big for one person to replicate.</p>
<p>When we do our research, we need to  <strong><em>find businesses that are viable for us to execute as a one-person team</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>A business that you can build a first version of within three months</li>
<li>A business that is a simple “do one thing well” product (i.e. a logo creator, geocode service, etc.)</li>
<li>A business you believe you can stick with for 2+ years</li>
<li>A market in which you think you will “like” the type of customers it serves</li>
<li>A business that is not based on any type of proprietary knowledge that you have no idea about. For example, it would make no sense to copy a business that teaches how to grow herbs if you have no idea how to grow herbs.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, where can we find businesses to get inspiration?</p>

<p>Very Important Note</p>
<hr>
<p>This strategy should generally only be considered if your side project has a smallish revenue goal rather than swinging for the fences.</p>
<p>In other words, this strategy works best if your goal is to take a small slice of a much larger market.</p>
<p>For Clarity</p>
<p>Small markets could easily soak up $20k/mrr. Medium markets could easily soak up $100k/mrr. Large markets $1m/mrr. As long as the revenue for the market is a drop in the ocean compared to that market size you should be fine.</p>
<p>Outright Theft</p>
<hr>
<p>A friend of mine built and owns a sucessful WordPress plugin. One issue with WordPress plugins is that anyone has access to the full source code.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion, people have stolen his actual source code and released it on the WordPress plugin store as their own work. WordPress does not ban this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I am not in any way recommending something like that. That is outright theft.</p>
<p>This entire lesson is talking about getting inspiration from other existing products and building your own version with a goal to become differentiated and unique. I.e.  <em>not</em>  stealing.</p>
