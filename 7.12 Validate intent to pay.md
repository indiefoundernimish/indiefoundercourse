<p><em>Method</em></p>
<ul>
<li>After your Super Seeds have confirmed that your mockups solve their problem, make sure you’re all clear on intent to pay!</li>
<li>Don’t worry about creating a detailed pricing plan at this point. We’ll get to that in Stage 9. Just confirm intent to pay in the range that you’ve identified in your Product Founder Fit.</li>
<li>Mark this action as Complete after your Super Seeds have confirmed their intent to pay at a price point you can accept.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>So your Super Seeds like your product idea  <em>and</em>  your mockups - great! But there’s one more critical step. Do they like it, and want it,  <em>enough to pay for it.</em></p>
<p>To understand if your Super Seeds have intent to pay, ask them the following pricing questions:</p>
<p>Price Discovery Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>How helpful would  <em>&lt;<em>your solution</em>&gt;</em>  be for you vs. what you have to do now?</li>
<li>What would be the maximum price for  <em>&lt;<em>your solution</em>&gt;</em>  that seems too cheap, and you could not take it seriously?</li>
<li>What would be the minimum price for  <em>&lt;<em>your solution</em>&gt;</em>  that would seem trustable?</li>
<li>What would be the maximum price for  <em>&lt;<em>your solution</em>&gt;</em>  that would still feel like good value?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>You will want to make sure that their answers are not way out of alignment with your expectations. For example, if you need $100/customer to hit your revenue goals, and they come back with $5-$10, then there’s an issue.</p>
<p>But if they come back with $50-$70, then that is good enough for rock 'n roll. Keep in mind, under all circumstances they will most likely throw out numbers that are  <em>less</em>  than what they will  <em>actually</em>  pay.</p>
<p>Based on their response, you can go back to your idea and mockups and see if making tweaks would result in intent to pay. If your Super Seeds still have no intent after several rounds of revisions, it may be time to #FailFast. Check out the next lesson for details on this option.</p>
