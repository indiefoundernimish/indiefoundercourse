<ul>
<li>Why market type makes a difference to the ideas you choose.</li>

<p>Let’s take another look at the bottom two layers of the stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack-bottom.png" alt=""></p>
<p>_"_Customers" is such a generic word but  <em>customers</em>  are not generic at all. They are, in fact, quite specific.</p>
<p>If we want our product to gain any kind of traction,  <strong><em>we will need to think about what type of market we are capable of selling to</em></strong>.</p>
<p>For example, I might be the best salesman in the world, but if I am trying to sell software to school districts, there is no getting around the fact that it takes 6-18 months to make a school district sale. They only spend money during certain cycles, and they only buy specific products from specific budgets.</p>
<p>In other words,  <strong><em>“market type” makes a huge difference to the ideas that should remain on your list</em></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="market-quirks">Market Quirks</h3>
<p>Different markets have different quirks, which can make it easier or harder to sell to them depending on your setup.  <strong><em>This is something that should be taken into account as you think through which ideas to axe.</em></strong></p>
<p>Let’s explore a few examples. This is definitely not a comprehensive list, but it should give you an idea of some of the unique challenges that can impact your market choice.</p>
<p>Market Quirk: Education</p>
<hr>
<p>Speaking as someone who is a CTO and on the founding team of an EdTech company that has sold a platform into over 75 school districts, I can confirm EdTech is possible but very difficult and time consuming. It took us about $10 million investment to get to product/market fit.</p>
<p>In my experience there are two strategies that work in EdTech:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strategy #1:</strong>  Build a very high-touch sales team with a lot of very connected people in education and pay them a lot of money. Ex-superintendents, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy #2</strong>  Create a free product that goes viral with teachers. When over half the teachers in the district are using the product, go in with your sales team and pitch the district “Half your teachers are using our platform already. Why not pay to upgrade and get our security guarantee, productivity, district stats, etc.?”</li>
</ul>
<p>For both of those strategies, I can’t really see a way to do that without funding.</p>
<p>Additionally, districts have a long and complex sales cycle. Selecting the correct budget to sell into is important, as is an awareness of the district’s RFP process and limited purchasing window each year.</p>

<p>Market Quirk: Non Profits</p>
<hr>
<p>On the one hand, they are “non profit.” On the other hand, they are businesses and need business tools just like any other business.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of what you can offer them will not be tax deductible, so there’s a slight lack of incentive there.</li>
<li>If you can help them raise more money, they will pay for that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Market Quirk: High Street Businesses</p>
<hr>
<p>Local businesses like bars, restaurants, salons, pet grooming, small lawyers, etc., do not generally play well with small scrappy software side projects.</p>
<p>The main issue is they are on the front line and are dealing with their own daily cash flow issues. As an audience, they tend to be very demanding with the addition of wanting to spend as little money as possible.</p>

</ul>
<p>Market Quirk: Students</p>
<hr>
<p>In general, students don’t have very much money. This makes a big difference to the number of customers you need to acquire. In general, student price points max out at $10/year or $5/month unless parents are paying. So, you’d need quite a few thousand customers to make a living.</p>

<p>Market Quirk: Medical</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical Enterprise:</strong>  Carries the same baggage as standard enterprise (6-18 month sales cycle etc.) with the addition of  <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">HIPAA</a>, which creates a significant amount of legal compliance work on the startup. This route is almost impossible to consider with a small team and no funding.</li>
<li><strong>Medical Consumer:</strong>  Price points can match prosumer, but again, HIPAA becomes a very large aspect and can make it  <em>extremely difficult</em>  to bootstrap as a side project.</li>
