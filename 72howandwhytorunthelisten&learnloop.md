<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Why you should listen to and learn from the market before building anything</li>
<li>How to use hyper iteration to speed up your journey to the point of profitability</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="warp-speed">Warp Speed</h3>
<p>Sure, in comparison to Stages 1-6, Stage 7 is a bit slower.  <em>But</em>  in comparison to building an entire startup before we validate our idea, Stage 7 is like warp speed.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the the immutable formula for success:</p>
<p><strong>Customers</strong>  (i.e. You grow an audience.)</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Intent to Pay</strong>  (i.e. You learn what they want.)</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Product</strong>  (i.e. You build what they want.)</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You</strong>  (i.e. You make it all happen.)</p>
<p>=</p>
<p><strong>Successful Product Business</strong></p>
<p>We  <em>know</em>  that we have to get every layer of the stack in alignment before we can build a profitable business.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack-checked.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Remember, if we get stuck in those top two layers, we’re done for. And it happens all the time. The process looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a product idea</li>
<li>Work for months in isolation, developing the product</li>
<li>Release the product</li>
<li>No one knows or cares about the product</li>
<li>Feel sad</li>
<li>Get a new product idea…</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, this is an ineffective process. That’s why Stage 7, this stage on listening and learning, is critical. Not only will we learn how to validate our existing idea (or find an initial idea from the market), but we’ll also learn the fastest and most effective way to execute each layer of the stack.</p>
<h3 id="hyper-iteration">Hyper Iteration</h3>
<p>I touched on the concept of Hyper Iteration briefly in  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/stage/1/step/4">Stage 1, Learn how to keep it small and simple</a>. Now I’m ready to get deeper into the topic so we can start executing accordingly.</p>
<p>At this stage, we have a choice: we can execute each layer of the stack the slow way, or we can invoke the power of hyper iteration and get it done in a matter of months, sometimes weeks.</p>
<p>How is that possible?</p>
<p>Well, every business is nothing more than a continual cycle of one single question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I try this, will it be successful?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each iteration of that question often takes months or years to answer. For example, one iteration might be to spend 6 months building a product, then launching it.</p>
<p>But, if we compress each question/answer iteration to days or hours,  <strong><em>we can shrink the entire timeline exponentially</em></strong>, which in turn decreases our overall level of risk.</p>
<p>Here is the stack re-imagined with  <em>Hyper Iteration</em>  in mind:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack-iterations.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note how our journey to profitability becomes increasingly faster the more steps we iterate as shown on the left, as opposed to the right.</p>
<p>There are many scenarios in which we can choose a fast iterator over a slow one.</p>
<p>Examples of Fast vs. Slow Iteration</p>
<ul>
<li>Start executing right now  <strong>vs.</strong>  Seek funding from a VC</li>
<li>Mockup a product and sell the promise  <strong>vs.</strong>  Build a product and sell the real thing</li>
<li>Grow an email list 5 users a day  <strong>vs.</strong>  Run a PR campaign</li>
<li>Build a sales site with Squarespace  <strong>vs.</strong>  Custom code a sales website</li>
<li>Go to a niche meetup and ask people  <strong>vs.</strong>  Do extensive market research and SWOT analyses</li>
<li>Use Wizard of Oz Technique (which we’ll learn more about in Stage 12)  <strong>vs.</strong>  Build a real product</li>
<li>Proactively talk to customers  <strong>vs.</strong>  Rely on a self-serve feedback system</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking this approach helps us save our most valuable commodity:  <strong><em>time.</em></strong></p>
<p>It also gets us to the answer of…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I try this, will it be successful?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…as fast as possible.</p>
<h3 id="listen--learn--hyper-iteration">Listen &amp; Learn = Hyper Iteration</h3>
<p>Lest there be any doubt, this is our Hyper Iterative Groundhog Day loop:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find people</li>
<li>Talk to people and learn what they want</li>
<li>Mock it up to make sure we got it right</li>
<li>Validate their intent to pay</li>
<li>If we can’t validate it, then back to step 1</li>
<li>If we can validate, then on to Stage 8</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, we need to execute the left-hand side of the stack here:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack-iterations.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Remember, the most important part of validation is learning what our audience actually wants. Can we turn what they want into a product? And are they willing to pay for it?</p>
<p>Without answering these questions, whether we like it or not, we’re stuck in those top two layers of the stack, and we’re more likely to continue the idea-build-flop-repeat process than we are to hyper iterate our way to success.</p>
<p>So, let’s get to listening &amp; learning!</p>
