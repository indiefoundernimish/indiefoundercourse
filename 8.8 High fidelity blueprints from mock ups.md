<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>How to turn your blueprints into high fidelity mockups.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/hi-fi-mockup.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="why-create-high-fidelity-mockups">Why create high fidelity mockups?</h3>
<p>Here are some key reasons why our next best step is to create high fidelity mockups of our product:</p>
<ul>
<li>To show our  <em>Super Seeds</em>  and get a final sanity check. This will save us time and money before we start developing something for real.</li>
<li>To upgrade our landing page to  <em>Solid</em>. This will help it convert better by enabling visitors to touch &amp; feel our product idea.</li>
<li>To enhance our blueprints. This will save us time, money, frustration and un-needed iterations when we hand over to developers. Mainly because they will be able to see  <em>exactly</em>  what we want them to build with no room for error or misinterpretation.</li>
<li>To use as product visualizations for Betalist, Product Hunt and other sites that are great places to promote ourselves. In fact, without hi-fi mockups, this avenue would not even be open to us.</li>
<li>To show to other interested parties such as friends, family, and investors. This will help us  <em>help them</em>  understand our product vision with expediency and clarity.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note for Full Stack Devs</em></p>
<p>Another good reason to use hi-fi mockups is they represent the optimal path from the brain to production for a full stack developer.</p>
<p>For example, I used to design as I coded, then I would show the working product to end users. If the UI was wrong, I then need to go back and rework my code. This was a very time-consuming process.</p>
<p>Then I upgraded my workflow. I started to use lo-fi mockups and show them to end users before I started coding. If there was an issue, I could quickly change the mockup and iterate. Even so, it never fully solved the problem. There were still many times that lo-fi mockups did not have enough detail. So, I ended up needing to rework my code anyway.</p>
<p>Finally, I upgraded my workflow again. I switched to creating hi-fi mockups first pass, instead of lo-fi. Since hi-fi mockups are basically a rendering of the end product, they solved almost all of the mistakes and issues before coding work started.</p>
<p>For example, I used hi-fi mockups for the Batch Activity page. I iterated it with academy members and Laura before I did any coding. As you can see, the final hi-fi mockup is exactly how the end software looks and works.</p>

<p><em>Note for Varying Product Types</em></p>
<p>While a product blueprint is the right move regardless of product type, high fidelity mockups may not be possible for some. For instance, if you plan to sell an info product on an online MOOC, you’ll have limited options in how that content appears to the user.</p>
<p>However, we still recommend exploring the principals of design in  <em>Option #2</em>  of this lesson; they’ll be revisited when building out your full sales website in Stage 9.</p>
<h3 id="how-good-does-the-design-need-to-be">How good does the design need to be?</h3>
<p>Just like with our logo and landing page, we don’t need groundbreaking, world-leading design. All we’re looking for at this point is a design that is good enough to help us with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look like a trustworthy product</li>
<li>Look like a desirable product</li>
<li>Look like a professional product</li>
<li>Show similar quality to other products our customer pays for</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, we want to be sure that our design does not turn off our customer and does not lose us business.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-design-your-hi-fi-mockups">How to design your hi-fi mockups</h3>
<p>The subject of UI/UX/design is rather large. We can’t cover everything in this one lesson, but we can explore an overview of two viable paths to get your hi-fi mockups created.</p>
<p>I’ll list them in order of easiness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option #1: Outsource your hi-fi mockup design</strong></li>
<li><strong>Option #2: Design your hi-fi mockups yourself</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Important Design Note</p>
<hr>
<p>Please do not code up your design in HMTL, CSS, Bootstrap or any other framework! The results will be uninspiring, and this approach is the opposite of  <em>Hyper-Iteration</em>  for our current phase.</p>
<h4 id="option-1-outsource-your-hi-fi-mockup-design">Option #1: Outsource your hi-fi mockup design</h4>
<p>If you are not confident in your design skills right now, the fastest and easiest way to get your hi-fi mockups will be to to outsource. Derek Gehl at Entrepreneur Ignited put together a good overview of how this process works. If you want to go the outsource route, please watch this first and then continue:</p>
<p>Your next step will be to select a platform to outsource your work. Here are three platforms that I consider to be strong contenders for outsourced design work:</p>
<p>#1: 99 Designs (highest quality)</p>
<p>99 Designs is the premier place to commission design work. The entire platform is dedicated to design, so they have work flow tools that make it easy to work with designers. Here is the 99 Designs intro video:</p>
<p>99 Designs Links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://99designs.com/designers/search?categories%5B%5D=website-app-design&amp;designer-level%5B%5D=entry&amp;languages%5B%5D=en">Entry Level Designers @ 99 Designs</a>  (2,045)</li>

</ul>
<p>If you’re looking into this option, play with the filters on those pages to narrow the results.</p>
<h4 id="upwork-massive-workforce">#2: Upwork (massive workforce)</h4>
<p>Upwork is the conglomerated gorilla in this space and has the most workers. They also service the largest variety of work categories. Here is their intro video:</p>
<p>Upwork Links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/nss/90/hrs/100/?q=designers&amp;rate=0-10&amp;english=3&amp;last=15&amp;user_pref=2">Designers costing less than $10/hour @ Upwork</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/nss/90/hrs/100/?q=designers&amp;rate=10-30&amp;english=3&amp;last=15&amp;user_pref=2">Designers costing $10-$30/hour@ Upwork</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/nss/90/hrs/100/?q=designers&amp;rate=30-60&amp;english=3&amp;last=15&amp;user_pref=2">Designers costing $30-$60/hour@ Upwork</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, if you’re considering this option, play with the filters and the “U.S. only” on/off switch for more detailed results.</p>
<p><em>Recommended Listening!</em></p>
<p>My TechZing co-host, Jason Roberts, explains how he found a great designer on  <a href="https://upwork.com/">Upwork</a>  in the episode below. The relevant clip automatically starts around 20 minutes in and lasts about 30 min.</p>
<h4 id="fiverr-cheapest">#3: Fiverr (cheapest)</h4>
<p>Fiverr is a marketplace that is a nice combination of easy &amp; cheap. Here is the Fiver intro video:</p>
<p>Fiverr Links &amp; Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/categories/graphics-design/web-plus-mobile-design">Web and mobile designers @ Fiverr</a></li>
<li>You probably won’t be able to get a Skype interview with these providers.</li>
<li>Less likely to do true custom work for you.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important Outsourcing Note</em></p>
<p>During the outsource quoting process, be sure to post your lo-fi mockups and mind-maps in your job description and get quotes based off of those specifications.</p>
<h4 id="option-2-design-your-hi-fi-mockups-yourself">Option #2: Design your hi-fi mockups yourself</h4>
<p>Designing your hi-fi mockups yourself might be a bit harder than outsourcing, but it will allow you unprecedented control over what you are doing, and it can be a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Since design is such a visual concept, you’ll benefit more from  <em>seeing</em>  than just from reading. So, I’ve curated a set of primer videos from YouTube below to help get you started. The first four are from  <a href="https://www.gcflearnfree.org/beginning-graphic-design/">GCFLearnFree.org</a>  - check out their site for the same content in written format if you prefer.</p>
<p>All in all, the five videos below comprise just over half an hour of viewing time, but keep in mind that you don’t need to digest them all in one sitting! Consider watching one or two at a time, and jot down some notes on how the concepts might apply to your upcoming design work.</p>
<p>The Fundamentals of Design (5 minutes)</p>
<p>Watch this one at the beginning, then watch it after you’ve watched all the other videos, then watch it one more time for good measure. It’s by far the most important.</p>
<p>Learn how to Use Color (5 minutes)</p>
<p>As you’ll see in this video, color theory is quite scientific, but also quite simple.</p>
<p>Learn how to Use Typography (6 minutes)</p>
<p>Now we’re starting to layer on top of the fundamentals. Keep in mind that thin type is low contrast and thick type is high contrast and can be used to draw (or push away) the viewer’s eye.</p>
<p>Learn how to Use Images in (5 minutes)</p>
<p>This is a great overview on how to use images effectively in design.</p>
<p>Learn how to Lead the Viewers Eye - (14 minutes)</p>
<p>It is incredibly important to practice thinking this way, as it is a fundamental skill required to get your users to do what you want. This lesson is a bit long but does get to the point in the final 4 minutes.</p>
<p>We’ll talk more about this subject in future stages.</p>
<h3 id="your-brand-is-the-center-of-your-onion">Your Brand is The Center of Your Onion</h3>
<p>Something that isn’t mentioned in the above videos is how your logo and brand should be the “Center of the Onion” of your overall design.</p>
<p>So, make sure that your full design color scheme matches your logo. You can easily do that using  <a href="http://paletton.com/">Paletton</a>  and setting the base RGB color as the main color of your logo.</p>
<p>After you have your base color plugged in, you can play with the different color schemes such as Monochromatic, Adjacent, Triad, Tetrad.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-16-133519.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you can’t find a good scheme, then you might want to consider finding a color scheme you like and reworking the logo using that new scheme.</p>
