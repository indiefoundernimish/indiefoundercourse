<h3 id="man-on-wire--introduction">Man on Wire / Introduction</h3>
<p>Man on Wire is the framework (and mental model) I use for user persuasion.</p>
<p>I created this concept in 2008 and have used it daily since that time. I use it when creating software, writing copy, and making sales. I’m using it now. It’s a way of keeping a user engaged and nudging them to do what you want by laying out a path of irresistible breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>For example, you’ll probably read what I say next, because I’ve hopefully sold you on the idea that you’re about to learn something useful.</p>
<p>And… you’re reading this line, right? That’s an example of Man on Wire. Furthermore, if I’ve done my job correctly, you’ll find it very difficult to not read the next few paragraphs.</p>
<p>Still reading? Ok, I promise I’ll explain how you can use this method to your advantage in just a moment…</p>
<h3 id="man-on-wire--origin-story">Man on Wire / Origin Story</h3>
<p>Inspiration for Man on Wire came from the award winning 2008 documentary of the same name. The protagonist, Philippe Petit, illegally walked a high wire between the Twin Towers in New York. To achieve this death-defying feat, he broke in, secured a steel cable from one tower to the other, and walked across.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/cable.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>The relevant part:</strong>  How did he secure a steel cable between those two towers? They were 148ft apart. It’s not like he could throw it across. He had no crane to help him. He didn’t even have permission to be there.</p>
<p>Here’s how he did it:</p>
<p>Philippe smuggled an assortment of different sized threads, strings, ropes, a steel cable, and a bow and arrow to the roof of one of the towers.</p>
<p>An associate broke into the other tower. Philippe tied a thread to the arrow and then shot it from one roof to the other. Then he tied a larger piece of string to the thread. The associate pulled the thread and string over. Philippe tied a piece of rope to the string. The associate pulled it over.</p>
<p>They continued like this, each time adding a thicker strand, until finally they pulled the steel cable across.</p>

<p>When applied to user engagement, this is a very powerful mental image. It encapsulates the concepts of narrative drive, irresistible breadcrumbs, reeling someone in, and leaving nothing to chance.</p>

<p>Man on Wire breaks down the problem of achieving a desired user outcome into baby steps. Rather than thinking about the whole journey, we refine our focus onto only two wires at any one time.</p>
<p>The difference is subtle, but powerful.</p>
<p>Where standard thinking might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the user to my home page and get them to click a call to action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Man on Wire thinking looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Wire 1] Get the user to my home page</li>
<li>[Wire 2] Get the user to read the headline. Do whatever it takes. Make it big, make it bold, make it interesting. They should look at nothing else before this.</li>
<li>[Wire 3] Get the user to read the sub heading next. Do whatever it takes. Their attention should not be drawn to anything else. It should be positioned so that their eye lands on it directly after reading the title. It should further support the headline by listing additional supporting benefits.</li>
<li>[Wire 4] Get the user to read 1st testimonial next. Do whatever it takes. Use position and contrast to draw the eye. The user’s attention should not wander anywhere else. Use the testimonials to further sell what the previous wires sold.</li>
<li>[Wire 5] Get the user to read 2nd testimonial next. Do whatever it takes.</li>
<li>[Wire 6] Get the user to click a call to action next. Position it so the eye lands on it directly after reading the 2nd testimonial. Use relevant text in the button to maintain momentum and build on what was just said.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help you visualize, I converted the above 6 wires into a simple example landing page:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/mow-home.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice how your attention is drawn from one wire to the next in the order designed.</p>
<p><em>That’s</em>  Man on Wire.</p>
<h3 id="man-on-wire--theory">Man on Wire / Theory</h3>
<p>You’ll note I said ‘do whatever it takes’ to draw the user from one wire to the other. There are really only four main ways to do this: Order of gaze, visuals, curiosity, and reward.</p>
<p><strong>1: Order of Gaze</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Position the next wire within the natural order of gaze: left-to-right, top-to-bottom.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2: Visuals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bring attention to the next wire by making something visually stand out.</li>
<li>Use space and position to draw the gaze to the next wire.</li>
<li>Remove attention from non essential information by fading it out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3: Curiosity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What happens next?</li>
<li>What will I learn if I keep going?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4: Reward</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You will get something good if you do this.</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as you connect each wire using the above methods, you will be able to guide your users as needed.</p>
<p>To restate, the trick is to focus your efforts on perfecting the connection between any two wires at a time. The whole journey will take care of itself. It’s a little bit like driving down a twisty country lane. You can only see the curve ahead, but in the end you will get to your destination.</p>
<p>If you would like to see a very large example of this concept in action, have a look at this course. Every sentence, image, paragraph, lesson and module has been connected using Man on Wire.</p>
