<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The pros &amp; cons of different product types</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/choices.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Just like market type, the product type you decide to launch  <strong><em>will make a huge difference to your overall strategy.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="recommended-product-types">Recommended Product Types</h3>
<p>Some product types are easier than others for a single founder to make money on the internet. I recommend you  <strong><em>strongly consider the following product types for your first venture.</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="info-product">#1: Info Product</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Highly Recommended</li>
<li>Difficultly Level: 1/5, Low</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone has an expertise in something. An info product (education product) is the perfect way to dip a toe in the water when starting out.</p>
<p><strong><em>Highly recommended as a first revenue generating product.</em></strong></p>
<p>As an example, the first product built by 37signals was a $75 eBook,  <em>not</em>  Basecamp.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create a first version within 1-3 months.</li>
<li>Learn the foundational business and marketing knowledge required for any other product type.</li>
<li>No need to build any tech; there are already lots of great platforms to sell info products.</li>
<li>Build an info product as a one-man project.</li>
<li>Start off with an in-built affinity with the subject matter and the audience.</li>
<li>Sell an info product within the $50-$100 price range.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Will not get recurring revenue from a first project.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platforms for Building &amp; Selling Info Products</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://teachable.com/">Teachable</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thinkific.com/">Thinkific</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Even though info product revenue is not generally reoccurring, it is possible to create full-time revenue by setting high price points or getting a lot of customers. Either way, this will most likely not happen for your first few info products.</li>
<li>I do not recommend publishing your info product on a platform like Udemy. While it is nice that they have a built-in audience, you will lose at least 50% of your revenue. Also, it’s important to learn how to build your audience from the ground up so you can apply that knowledge to future products.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="productized-service">#2: Productized Service</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Recommended</li>
<li>Difficulty Level: 2/5, Medium</li>
</ul>
<p>A productized service is often created out of a service that you’ve delivered before as a freelancer or at a previous job. That means you’ve already seen first hand that clients/companies have been willing to pay for such a solution.</p>
<p>A classic example of a productized service is  <a href="https://wpcurve.com/">WP Curve</a>: you pay as low as $79/month and get Word Press techies who will work on your server and/or custom Word Press development.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The fastest path to offering an end product to the user that gives them 100% value.</li>
<li>Learn the foundational business and marketing knowledge required for any other product type.</li>
<li>Get more money than freelancing for your time when multiple people subscribe to your productized service.</li>
<li>Nothing to build other than a sales site.</li>
<li>High price points out of the box.</li>
<li>Usually a pre-validated market.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult to scale beyond your personal capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="saas-app">#3: SaaS App</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Recommended</li>
<li>Difficultly Level: 3/5, Hard</li>
</ul>
<p>A SaaS app offers founders the holy grail of side projects.  <strong><em>Recurring predictable flywheel revenue that comes in month after month.</em></strong></p>
<p>If founders do a good job of on-boarding, marketing, and reducing churn, they may be able to leave their day job and become their own boss.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recurring predictable flywheel revenue.</li>
<li>Life-changing revenue can be achieved with as few as 200 customers (depending on price points).</li>
<li>There are many untapped niches and opportunities (approx. 10,000 SaaS companies in total).</li>
<li>Possible to find a repeatable strategy to acquire customers by spending money. This can make big gains in the customer base.</li>
<li>Earn revenue with simple CRUD applications. No need for fancy technology.</li>
<li>Tools like  <a href="https://spark.laravel.com/">Laravel Spark</a>  can make it easy to build the billing side of the business and allow founders to focus on the core application logic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Growing the customer base can feel difficult, painful, and slow.</li>
<li>Growth often happens in fits and spurts; sometimes it is hard to understand what worked and why.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="neutral-product-types">Neutral Product Types</h3>
<p>These product types can make money on the internet. I do not recommend them, but I also do not  <em>not</em>  recommend them.</p>
<h4 id="microstock">Microstock</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Neutral</li>
<li>Difficultly Level: 1/5, Low</li>
</ul>
<p>Microstock is a market for selling photos online (and also vector images and video) at low prices and with a royalty free license. It is part of the Stock Photography industry.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Earn money while you sleep.</li>
<li>Low barrier to entry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To earn a decent amount of money, you would need to build quite a massive collection.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="some-microstock-sites">Some Microstock sites</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://submit.shutterstock.com/">Shutterstock</a>  - Sell pictures &amp; videos.</li>
<li><a href="https://join.flaticon.com/">Flaticon</a>  - Sell icons.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="membership-site">Membership Site</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Neutral</li>
<li>Difficultly Level: 2/5, Medium</li>
</ul>
<p>Membership sites are usually info products with a member portal where members pay an ongoing fee to get access to content and other members.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recurring revenue.</li>
<li>Upgrade an info product to recurring revenue.</li>
<li>Many pre-built options (no tech to build).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Churn rate can be high.</li>
<li>Content can become stale to members if not managed carefully.</li>
<li>There is a lot of snake oil internet marketing in the membership site domain.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="wordpress-plugin">WordPress Plugin</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Neutral</li>
<li>Difficultly Level: 2/5, Medium</li>
</ul>
<p>A WordPress plugin is a piece of software that can extend functionality or add new features to WordPress websites.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress plugins are small and easy to do, which means you can validate an idea quickly.</li>
<li>Launching doesn’t take too much time, and there’s a public repo for them, which gives you traffic.</li>
<li>Large community around them; freelancers use them. Getting a freelancer who blogs to promote them can help you get customers quickly.</li>
<li>Lots of resources available to learn how to create them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For most WordPress plugins, it’s difficult to generate recurring revenue.</li>
<li>There is a lot of commoditization and competition.</li>
<li>The customers, in general, are quite price-sensitive.</li>
<li>The market gets more crowded each year.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Here’s some advice about WordPress from a Nugget member:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were looking for opportunities I’d browse the WP repository (<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins">wordpress.org/plugins</a>) for popular plugins that haven’t been touched in a while (e.g.  <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/">this one</a>  with 1M+ active installs that hasn’t been touched in years).</p>
<p>I’d then reach out to the author and ask to adopt it (e.g. take it over). I’d work on stabilizing the plugin, then reach out to existing customers (likely through a survey in the plugin) about what features they’d be interested in and work on a premium version of it. It’s similar to Rob Walling’s strategy of taking over apps, just at a smaller (cheaper) scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="platform-plugin">Platform Plugin</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Neutral</li>
<li>Difficultly Level: 2/5, Medium</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get a head start if you build a platform plugin on a third party platform like Salesforce, Shopify, Magento, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Built in marketing &amp; customers by using the platform’s marketplace (up to a point).</li>
<li>Good revenue price points on many commerce-oriented platforms such as Salesforce, Shopify, Magento etc.</li>
<li>Often times there is zero UI or design work required, so this option works well for people without “an eye.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Customer potential is limited to customers already using the platform.</li>
<li>When externally marketing your product, you are also market  <em>their platform</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="desktop-app">Desktop App</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Neutral</li>
<li>Difficultly Level: 3/5, Hard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Native software is fast.</li>
<li>Can build more complex apps.</li>
<li>No server or infrastructure costs for most desktop apps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hard to get started if not already a native app developer.</li>
<li>Support burden can be extra difficult because different users have different versions of the software installed.</li>
<li>Very difficult to get recurring revenue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="not-recommended-product-types">Not Recommended Product Types</h3>
<p>While it is possible to make money from these product types, I do not recommend them. In these cases, the cons often outweigh the pros.</p>
<h4 id="advertising-revenue-aka-adsense">Advertising Revenue (AKA AdSense)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Not Recommended</li>
<li>Difficulty Level: 1/5, Low</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of passive income just by publishing a website with some content is a seductive one… but, it has had it’s day. Perhaps 5-10 years ago this was a viable strategy.</p>
<p>These days it’s hard to make more than a few dollars with AdSense after Google demoted these types of sites in their search algorithm.</p>
<h4 id="mobile-app">Mobile App</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Not Recommended</li>
<li>Difficultly Level: 3/5, Hard</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile apps don’t need much introduction!</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There are good frameworks that make it easy to build native-feeling mobile apps.</li>
<li>A mobile app can be a big compliment to a SaaS product and increase its value proposition.</li>
<li>No server or infrastructure costs for most mobile apps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over 40m competitors.</li>
<li>If not on home screen, app can be quickly forgotten.</li>
<li>$0.99 per sale.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Funny story. In 2016, I joined a membership site of a mobile app guru. He’s made millions from mobile apps. I sent him a private message describing my skill-set and asking what the best thing for me to build was. His response?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build a SaaS app. It’s a better revenue model.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="advertising-revenue-aka-twitter-facebook-etc.">Advertising Revenue (AKA Twitter, Facebook, Etc.)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Not Recommended</li>
<li>Difficulty Level: 5/5, Maximum</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s  <em>very difficult</em>  to build predictable advertising revenue unless you have a large amount of funding. To do this, you need millions of viewers and a very long cash runway to build that audience.</p>
<h4 id="marketplace">Marketplace</h4>
<ul>
<li>Recommendation: Not Recommended</li>
<li>Difficulty Level: 5/5, Maximum</li>
</ul>
<p>A two-sided marketplace is something like Uber, eBay, Airbnb, etc.</p>
<p>They are very difficult to build because you need to leverage demand from both sides of the market - both the consumer and the provider. In other words, you don’t just need to market one product, you need to market two!</p>
<p>I’ve put this last in the list because I think two-sided marketplaces are a terrible idea for a first product or as a side project.</p>
<p>If you would like to get a little deeper into the pros and cons of any particular product type, or you are wondering about something that is not mentioned here, please feel free to ask questions in Discord.</p>
