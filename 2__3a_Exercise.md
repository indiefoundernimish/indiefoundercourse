<h1 id="dig-up-some-ideas-from-niches--communities">Dig up some ideas from niches &amp; communities</h1>
<p><em>If you have any questions about this action, ask us in Discord, we will answer there and add to an FAQ here.</em></p>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>Follow these steps to come up with some ideas from a niche market and post your findings in Discord:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pick a community/market that you would be happy to work with.</li>
<li>Search for forums for that market.</li>
<li>Browse forum topics and then skim the ones where it sounds like people might be voicing their pain points.</li>
<li>Create a working document to take note of any comment in which a member of the community voices a pain point.</li>
<li>Look for trends in these comments to identify common problem areas.</li>
<li>Generate an idea that could solve their problem - get creative!</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="hints">Hints</h4>
<p>Try to spend no more than 30-60 minutes on this action, and jot your idea(s). Don’t worry if you’re not 100% excited about this idea - the point is to continue generating the list.</p>
<p>Actually, talking to members of this market could lead you to an even better idea, but for now, give the above process a try!</p>

<p><em>Important Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Ideally, I would like you to find a few ideas this way. If you find this exercise too difficult, or it is taking too long, enter some markets you like.</li>
<li>With that in mind I’ve added another lesson that is the lazy man’s version of this process. Lesson 12  <em>Learn how to get ideas using Mechanical Turk</em>.</li>
<li>You can come back to this action if you don’t have enough ideas (30+) by the end of this stage or you can use lesson 12 to generate ideas for more than one niche.</li>
</ul>
