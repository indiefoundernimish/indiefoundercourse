<ul>
<li><strong>Step #1</strong>: Create a skeleton Mind Map that defines the structure of your product</li>
<li><strong>Step #2</strong>: Create a lo-fi mockup for each page</li>
<li><strong>Step #3</strong>: Upload your snowball blueprint documents to your website @ <a href="http://yoursite.com/blueprint/v1">http://yoursite.com/blueprint/v1</a> -  <a href="http://fire.ci/blueprints/v1">Please see this Example</a>  - (and enter link into response box below)</li>
<li><strong>Step #4</strong>: Create a written description for each page (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Take your time on this action, but don’t get  <em>too</em>  hung up on the design of each page. Important design elements will come into play in the next lesson, and you may decide you want to work with a designer to fully flesh out the visuals.</p>
<p>For now, focus on functionality. And again, depending on your product type, make adjustments as needed. Regardless of product, a detailed blueprint is your next best move.</p>
<p><em>As you’ll see in the final action of this stage, the Listen &amp; Learn loop is far from over! In completing Stage 7, you already ran some mockups by your seed group. It’s time to revisit that effort! Be sure to share your blueprint with your Super Seeds, and revise it as needed based on their feedback.</em></p>
