<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Select an option. Choose to outsource your hi-fi mockup design, or design your hi-fi mockups yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2a</strong>: If outsourcing, explore your options via sites like  <a href="https://99designs.com/">99 Designs</a>,  <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a>, and  <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a>. Use filters to narrow your results, and follow their procedures for posting your project, being sure to include your product blueprint.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3a</strong>: Interview your designer if at all possible! Discuss the scope of work, timeline, etc. and make sure they’re the right fit.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4a</strong>: Check in with your designer throughout the specified timeline. If you follow the advice of the first video in the previous lesson, you should be in good shape to come out with some high-quality hi-fi designs!</li>
<li><strong>Step 2b</strong>: If you’re designing your own hi-fi mockups, select your mockup tool, which may or may not be the same as the tool you used to create your product blueprint sketches or lo-fi mockups in Stage 7.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3b</strong>: If designing your own, remember to consider the fundamentals of design, color, typography, etc. Review the videos in the previous lesson as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Design can be an iterative process. Consider sharing drafts with your batch on Slack as you work. And if your product type doesn’t require hi-fi designs, consider sharing your blueprints and next steps. Even though they’re not part of your seed group, other Academy members will likely have some helpful perspectives, and you’ll be an inspiration to those who haven’t made it this far yet!</p>
<p>You guessed it - yes! You should share your completed designs with your seed group! Even though they’ve seen your blueprint, they may have new insights and ideas after seeing the details. And they may get even more excited about becoming your first paying customers, too!</p>
