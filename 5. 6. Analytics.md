<p>Imagine your landing page was a dating profile. Of course you’ll want to know when you get a match (like an email signup in this case), but wouldn’t it also be nice to know how many times people view your profile?</p>
<p>If you’re getting lots of views but no takers, maybe you should change your profile pic.</p>
<p>If you’re getting no views at all, maybe you’re not the right fit for this particular dating platform (i.e. market/idea) and you should try another. It’s the same idea with basic site analytics.</p>
<p>Analytics can provide tons of insight, but as usual, there’s no need to go crazy at this point!</p>
<p>We just want to capture the basics of how many visitors we’re getting daily. Then, we can see if different strategies we use in the next Stage generate more interest than others</p>
<p>It’s good to get this done now so we can see trends and learn over time.</p>
