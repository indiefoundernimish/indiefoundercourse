<h1 id="listen--learn-validate-your-mockups">Listen &amp; Learn: Validate your Mockups</h1>
<p><em>Method</em></p>
<p>After your Super Seeds have confirmed you’re on to something with your idea, mock it up, share it with your Super Seeds, and iterate as necessary.</p>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>It’s time to go for it! Get excited - you may be mocking up the product you’ll end up launching!</p>
<p>But a word of caution - remember that you’re still in the validation phase. This mockup may prove that you’re misunderstanding what your seed group has been telling you. You may be focusing in on the wrong area, or they may realize they’re actually not that excited about the idea once they see it.</p>
<p>When asking for feedback, focus on these questions:</p>
<p>Mockup Feedback Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this idea help solve the problem XYZ?</li>
<li>Does the UI feel intuitive?</li>
<li>How could this solve the problem XYZ better? (If it’s good as is, that’s fine!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on their response, you can adjust the mockup and try again, tackle a new problem altogether and start a new mockup from scratch, or move on to pricing validation! Check out the next action for details on pricing.</p>
