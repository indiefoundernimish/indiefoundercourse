<h1 id="grow-your-seed-group">Grow your seed group</h1>
<p><em>Important - You’ve Unlocked New Capabilities!</em></p>
<p>You’ve just hit a milestone! By entering this step, you’ve unlocked your ability to select your seed group strategies and track your progress on the  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/project/edit">Project Page</a>! Select the strategies you identified in Stage 6, and start checking in on that page every time you work on growing your seed group. As you gain more seeds, you’ll be showcased closer to the top of the  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/founders">Founders Page</a>.</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mark this action as complete when you discover 1 Super Seed</li>
<li>Your on-going goal is to discover 5-10 Super Seeds.</li>
<li>This action should be run in parallel with all remaining steps in Stage 7. Be sure to continue working through Stage 7 while finding your Super Seeds.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Critical</strong></p>
<p>Even after marking this action as Complete, keep growing your seed group and get as many Super Seeds as possible until your full marketing plan takes over in Stage 11.</p>
<h3 id="the-definition-of-seeds-and-super-seeds">The Definition of “Seeds” and “Super Seeds”</h3>
<p><strong>Seeds</strong></p>
<p>A seed is anyone who want’s your product to exist and who you have a way to contact and ask questions.</p>
<p>So, perhaps they are on your mailing list, or in your Slack, or maybe they are a friend etc.</p>
<p><strong>Super Seeds</strong></p>
<p>They are the same as Seeds except they are  <em>very</em>  engaged with you and excited to be part of what you are working on.</p>
<p>They are usually experts in the market that your product is serving and love the idea of helping you think it through and adding their voice to your product.</p>
<p>You will be able to ask these folks a lot of questions and have multiple discussions about your project without over extending your welcome.</p>
<p>They may also be able to refer you to other Seeds and Super Seeds.</p>
<p>They might also want to live vicariously through the work you are doing and will be proud to be there since the beginning.</p>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>For ongoing discussion and feedback Slack is the best with email a close second.</li>
<li>Face-to-face sessions are excellent to get lots of feedback in one go.</li>
<li>Voice/video sessions are almost as good as face-to-face and easier to schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Method</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Grow your seed group using the growth strategies you picked in Stage 6.</li>
<li>Track your key progress in the action response box below.</li>
<li>Continue with the rest of this stage.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>I recommend spending at least 15-30 minutes/day on your growth strategies.</p>
<p>Everyone’s schedule is different, so seed group growth may go faster for some than others. The key note to remember is to keep up your momentum. If it helps, use the Momentum Tracker to keep you on task.</p>
<p>We never want to stop growing our customer base. That’s why we want to keep growing our seed group until out full marketing plan takes over in Stage 11.</p>
<p>If after a couple weeks you’re still struggling to break just 10 emails, we may have a problem. It could be that you just need some support in implementing your growth methods. It could be that your market is particularly niche and therefore harder to find people in.</p>
<p>Or, it is possible that you’re just in the wrong market. If you’re unable to collect 20-50 emails in your market at this stage, it may be time to consider moving on to a new idea. I’ll discuss that in more depth in the lesson on how to #FailFast.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, we’re all here to support each other. If you’re feeling stuck, reach out in Discord.</p>
