<h1 id="learn-what-to-include-on-your-landing-page">Learn what to include on your landing page</h1>
<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What to include on your landing page during each stage of the validation process.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you are still exploring a market and don’t have a product hypothesis just yet, don’t worry. You can make a generic brand and landing page for your market, and evolve it as a product idea emerges.</em></p>

<h3 id="the-three-states-of-validation-landing-pages">The Three States of Validation Landing Pages</h3>
<p>With best practice in mind, there are three states our landing page should go through during product validation.</p>
<p>Each state has just the right components on the page to get the job done for that part of the validation process.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State #1</strong>: Vapor</li>
<li><strong>State #2:</strong>  Liquid</li>
<li><strong>State #3:</strong>  Solid</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Don’t Get Ahead of Yourself</em></p>
<ul>
<li>We will be discussing how to get people to our landing page in  <em>Stage 6: Pick a Seed Group Strategy</em>.</li>
<li>We will be discussing how to interview customers and find out what they want in  <em>Stage 7: Listen &amp; Learn</em>.</li>
<li>So, don’t worry about these aspects for now! Also, keep in mind that in this stage, you’ll be building a “Vapor” landing page. It’s important to read the context of the “Liquid” and “Solid” pages as well, but don’t worry about executing that amount of detail until later. Let the actions in the coming stages guide you on when to take these critical steps.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="state-1-vapor">State #1: Vapor</h4>
<p>During the very earliest stages of validation, our product idea is ephemeral. It can change as quickly as it takes to have a single customer conversation.</p>
<p>We have the beginnings of an idea, and we are just starting to talk to people about it.</p>
<p>We need a dynamic landing page we can instantly update to reflect our current thinking. We want as few components as possible to get the job done.</p>
<h4 id="state-1-vapor-landing-page-components">State #1: Vapor Landing Page Components</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo</strong>  - Our starter brand</li>
<li><strong>Headline</strong>  - Our product benefits in as few words as possible</li>
<li><strong>Subheading</strong>  - Our solution &amp; benefits in slightly more detail</li>
<li><strong>Waitlist Signup</strong>  - An email box to capture people’s email addresses</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="state-1-vapor-landing-page-example">State #1: Vapor Landing Page Example</h4>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/happy-lp1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As we talk to customers, we can continually update the headline and subheading to reflect our latest and greatest thinking.</li>
<li>It acts as the perfect calling card to send to any potential customers, with the goal to collect their email address.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Stages 5 and 6, you’ll be working with just the  <em>Vapor</em>  version of your landing page. This version can work whether you have a product idea or just a market. For instance, if your market is  <em>authors</em>, you can create a starter brand around that audience, and use a generic tagline like “Sytems and Services to Help Authors.”</p>
<h4 id="state-2-liquid">State #2: Liquid</h4>
<p>After we speak to a few customers, we will begin to hear some common problems. With this learning, we can change the state of our landing page from  <em>Vapor</em>  to  <em>Liquid</em>.</p>
<p>We do this by adding a new component:  <strong><em>Feature Bullets.</em></strong></p>
<p>Basically, we now add a list of more detailed features to our page. We choose these features by reflecting the problems the customer revealed to us during discussions.</p>
<p>Yes, we could have  <em>guessed</em>  about feature bullets before now, but we would be shooting ourselves in the foot for the following reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Reasons to NOT Guess Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we guess features without talking to customers, we have a high chance of getting it wrong.</li>
<li>If we guess features customers don’t want, they will not enter their email address.</li>
<li>If we guess features, we are leading the witness. We’re putting words in their mouths before taking the time to listen. They might parrot those words back to us, but then when it comes to actually  <em>buying</em>  the product… no dice. They won’t buy if we’re not solving a genuine problem they’re having, and we won’t know that problem unless we listen to it before we suggest a solution.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="state-2-liquid-landing-page-components">State #2: Liquid Landing Page Components</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo</strong>  - Our starter brand</li>
<li><strong>Headline</strong>  - Our product benefits in as few words as possible</li>
<li><strong>Subheading</strong>  - Our solution &amp; benefits in slightly more detail</li>
<li><strong>Waitlist Signup</strong>  - An email box to capture people’s email addresses</li>
<li><strong>Feature Bullets</strong>  - A list of feature/benefit bullet points</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="state-2-liquid-landing-page-example">State #2: Liquid Landing Page Example</h4>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/happy-lp2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we “get it right” and list features that customers want, we will increase conversions and get more email addresses.</li>
<li>We can instantly change headline, subheading, or feature bullets as we continue to learn.</li>
<li>As our page becomes more complete, we can start to consider customer acquisition methods like Facebook advertising and PPC.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a  <em>Liquid</em>  landing page, it’s important to have an understanding of your product hypothesis in order to create the feature bullets. So if you’re page so far has been generic to your market, it’s at this point that you’ll need to update it to reflect a more specific product idea.</p>
<h4 id="state-3-solid">State #3: Solid</h4>
<p>With multiple customer conversations under our belt, we should now be achieving clarity about what customers want to pay for. Now that we know this, we can change the state of our landing page from  <em>Liquid</em>  to  <em>Solid</em>.</p>
<p>We do this by adding a new component:  <strong><em>High Fidelity Mockups.</em></strong></p>
<p>Mockups add high value to our landing page, but they come at a cost. They are slow and difficult to change compared to all the other page components.</p>
<p>For this reason, we should not add mockups until we are very clear about what customers want. Also, we must be sure to show our mockups to customers and iterate them  <em>before</em>  we put them on our landing page.</p>
<h4 id="state-3-solid-landing-page-components">State #3: Solid Landing Page Components</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logo</strong>  - Our starter brand</li>
<li><strong>Headline</strong>  - Our product benefits in as few words as possible</li>
<li><strong>Subheading</strong>  - Our solution &amp; benefits in slightly more detail</li>
<li><strong>Waitlist Signup</strong>  - An email box to capture people’s email addresses</li>
<li><strong>Feature Bullets</strong>  - A list of feature/benefit bullet points</li>
<li><strong>High Fidelity Mockups</strong>  - Get your customers to lick the screen</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="state-3-solid-landing-page-example">State #3: Solid Landing Page Example</h4>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/happy-lp3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we know what customers want  <em>and</em>  we create high fidelity product mockups, conversions might just go through the roof!</li>
<li>More than just a calling card, our landing page is now a fully featured pre-sales vehicle.</li>
<li>We can start to scale our marketing and take on paid customer acquisition as a major strategy.</li>
<li>We can even consider pre-selling our product with a downpayment and adding customers to a waitlist like Musk did with the Model 3.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve named this stage  <em>Solid</em>  to help with the analogy, but keep in mind you should always be ready to change your landing page based on important learnings from your customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Terms &amp; Privacy Links</em></p>
<p>If we want to use paid advertising to drive traffic to our landing page (Vapor, Liquid, or Solid), we also need to include footer links to Terms &amp; Privacy pages.</p>
<p>This is non-negotiable as far as companies like Google &amp; Facebook are concerned.</p>
<p>You can quickly create terms and privacy pages using the generators below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://termsandconditionstemplate.com/generate/">Terms Generator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://termsandconditionstemplate.com/privacy-policy-generator/">Privacy Generator</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Regarding the above brand  <em>Happy</em>: This was just a random word I chose as a brand example. Note how when the brand idea is linked with a product idea and a landing page, it already seems like a  <em>thing</em>, even though I’ve spent no time actually building the product.</p>
