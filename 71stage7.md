<p>Welcome to the Listen &amp; Learn Loop!</p>
<hr>
<p>This is the real deal. In this stage we have the chance to move our  <em>Vapor</em>  idea from a guess to a validated concept ready to become a profitable product.</p>
<p>The key point here is that  <strong>_<em>Listening &amp; Learning</em>  is a “pull” activity, not a “push.”_</strong>  In other words, we’re pulling ideas out of our audience, not pushing our existing ideas on them.</p>
<p>Sure, we may have a landing page with a starter idea,  <em>but</em>  that is only to get us started finding and talking to our Super Seeds.</p>
<p>Why? Well, it all goes back to ye old successful business stack.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Specifically, the bottom two layers, which I call  <em>Learning &amp; Earning</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack-bottom.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We need to  <em>Listen &amp; Learn</em>  so that we can turn our original guess into, at the very least, an educated guess.</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>You may be wondering, why bother to  <em>Listen &amp; Learn</em>  if our original idea is a sure-fire hit!</p>
<p>Well, first, nothing is a sure-fire hit.</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible we are on to something with our very first idea on our  <em>Vapor</em>  landing page. But even if it is a good idea, we don’t  <em>know</em>  that until we’ve validated it. Also, during  <em>Listening &amp; Learning</em>, we may discover there is a tangential idea that has  <em>way</em>  more earning potential.</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>We will now be running the following actions in parallel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growing our Seed Group</li>
<li>Identifying and nurturing Super Seeds</li>
<li>Listening &amp; Learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Which means this stage will take significantly more time than the others, because we’re really  <em>doing the work</em>  now. Stages 1-6 were pretty quick, but 7-12 are meatier and will take us longer.</p>
<p>If you have any hesitations or worries about keeping up with the work, please reach out to myself, Nimish, or the group on Discord to try to brainstorm a plan.</p>
