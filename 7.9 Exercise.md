<ul>
<li>Mark this action as Complete when at least 5-10 Super Seeds have agreed that your idea solves a problem for them and they clearly want it.</li>
<li>Our primary goal is to find a little snowball that will solve the most pain for the most people in our audience.</li>
<li>In addition to validating the product idea here, the last two actions in this stage will help you validate your product mockups and pricing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>Run the Listen &amp; Learn loop until you have uncovered a little snowball that your market clearly wants.</p>
<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>
<p>You don’t need to wait to have a full seed group before you start learning. As soon as you’ve made your first connection, go for it.</p>
<p>Also, during this process, take note of who is emerging as a Super Seed and pay special attention to them accordingly.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick reminder of the tools we have at our disposal:</p>
<p><strong>Listen &amp; Learn Tools</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slack-based customer interviews in our  <em>Super Seed Factory</em>, which makes it convenient to create ongoing dialogs.</li>
<li>In-person (or phone-based) customer interviews to dig deep into a customer’s story and process.</li>
<li>Email-based interviews that enable us to get quick top-level insights into where our market stands.</li>
<li>Survey-based interviews to zone in on specific features or expand our product idea set.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>If things aren’t working out, and it feels like you’re wading through mud on this idea, jump to the #FailFast lesson to see if it is time to cut loose and move on to the next one.</p>
