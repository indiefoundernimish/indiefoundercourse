<h4 id="online-community-strategy">Online Community Strategy</h4>
<p>The key point here is that no matter what our market is, there are already online niche communities with thousands of people that we can tap directly into.</p>
<p>This is one of the easiest and fastest strategies to start connecting with potential customers. That said, it does not generate  <em>lots</em>  of traffic, but it does generate high-quality traffic.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this lesson, when I say “online community” I mean the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A community where you can talk to people in a threaded discussion format</li>
<li>A community where you can have a profile or signature</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a list of specific communities I’m thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>  - A community for almost every topic</li>
<li><a href="https://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>  - A question and answer community</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/186/finding-and-joining-a-linkedin-group?lang=en">LinkedIn Groups</a>  - Business oriented groups for many topics</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1210322209008185/?helpref=hc_fnav">Facebook Groups</a>  - A group for almost every topic</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.standuply.com/the-full-list-of-1000-slack-communities-2c412054ea30">Slack Groups</a>  - A community for a lot of topics using Slack</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=online+forums">Online Forums</a>  - Millions of independent niche specific forums</li>
</ul>
<p>The online community growth strategy is simple. Here it is:</p>
<p><strong>Step #1:</strong>  Join  <em>relevant</em>  online communities</p>
<p><strong>Step #2:</strong>  Set up a compelling profile with a link to your landing page</p>
<p><strong>Step #3:</strong>  Talk to people</p>
<p>See below for more detail.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-join-relevant-forums-groups--platforms">Step #1: Join Relevant Forums, Groups, &amp; Platforms</h4>
<p>Well, all you have to do is find them!</p>
<p>Here are example searches to find online communities for the  <em>Happy</em>  niche of HR:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reddit+hr">reddit hr</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=quora+hr">quora hr</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=linkedin+hr+group">linkedin hr group</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook+hr+group">facebook hr group</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=human+resources+slack+group">human resources slack group</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=human+resources+forum">human resources forum</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest place to start will be Reddit because you only need to register once to get access to every niche subject.</li>
<li>Be sure to check what the correct etiquette is for any community you join. Often times, if you come on too strong, you will get backlash and hurt your chances of getting valuable insight.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="step-2-set-up-a-compelling-profile-with-a-link-to-your-landing-page">Step #2: Set Up a Compelling Profile with a Link to Your Landing Page</h5>
<p>When we interact with other online community members, some of them will check out our profile/signature. To capitalize on this, we need to say something compelling and add a link to our landing page.</p>
<p>Our goal is to get the viewer to like us on a personal level. We want them to want to support us by looking at what we’re doing.</p>
<p>Example Profile / Forum Signature</p>
<p>I’m working nights &amp; weekends building <a href="http://GetHappy.io">GetHappy.io</a>. It’s an app for HR teams to gamify the workplace! Check it out and send me your feedback :) - <a href="https://GetHappy.io">https://GetHappy.io</a></p>
<p>As with the Twitter strategy, this assumes we’re interacting with the HR-niche users. Here’s what the interaction looks like end to end.</p>
<p>End to End Example</p>
<ol>
<li>We search for HR related online communities</li>
<li>We join and edit our profile / signature</li>
<li>We talk to folks (be helpful, etc)</li>
<li>They look at our bio / signature</li>
<li>They click our landing page link</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="step-3-talk-to-people">Step #3: Talk to People</h4>
<p>When you log in, start by seeing if you can answer anyone’s question or make a valuable comment to an existing thread.</p>
<p>To keep things manageable, spend a total of 15-30 minutes per day logging in to your communities and talking to people.</p>
<p><em>Bonus Material / Marketing Tutorials</em></p>
<p>Here are some pre-baked Google searches that will return relevant tutorials.</p>
<p>It may be worth reading through some tutorials for the specific communities you’re interested in. There may be some tips/tricks that help with the nuance of each platform in question.</p>
