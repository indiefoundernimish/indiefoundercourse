<p>_ If you have any questions about this action, ask us in Discord, we will answer there and add to an FAQ here._</p>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Axe ideas that will keep you stuck in the top two tiers of ‘the stack.’</li>
<li>In other words, cut anything that you don’t think you’ll be able to approach in a user-first way.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>It’s time to return to your big list of ideas from Stage 2, and give it a close look.</p>
<p>Find the ideas that are most likely to keep you stuck in those top two tiers of ‘the stack.’</p>
<p>Be warned, some of these might be the ideas you were most excited about! But if you see yourself living in a little box with just you and the product, take another look.</p>
<p>Key Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you believe that you can build a customer base for the product without actually building the product?</li>
<li>Can you get to know their needs?</li>
<li>Do you think you can validate their intent to pay?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some Guidance</p>
<p><strong>A)</strong>  If I said to you “Do you think you could build a product (and audience) that served people who build sky scrapers” you’d probably say “No way!”</p>
<p><strong>B)</strong>  But if I said to you “Do you think you could build a product (and audience) that served web developers” you’d probably say, “I could give it a try”.</p>
<p>So now imagine that A is a 0 on a scale of 0 - 100. And B is 100.</p>
<p>Now you can grade your ideas against how comfortable you are building the audience.</p>
<p>So, you let’s say the audience was “carpenters” well it’s not 100 but also it’s not a 0.</p>
<p>Until now you’ve just picked ideas you like. The point of this exercise it to have realistic think, on a basic level, and weed out the non starters.</p>
<p>In other words, this is not scientific, your gut feel is fine, we’re just trying to weed out any ideas that seem really off the charts and a waste of time.</p>
<p>You will ultimately need to talk to customers in the market and we want to be sure that’s a possibility.</p>
<p>If not, and if you don’t see the potential to approach the idea from this customer-first angle, then it’s time to cross it off the list. It might be a fun product to build, but its chances of success are slim.</p>
