<p>Create your starter brand and logo using the concepts explained in the previous two lessons.</p>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>It’s time to have some fun with branding!</p>
<p>But here’s the challenge -  <strong><em>limit yourself to two hours</em></strong>  to pull together all components of your brand! That means no more than one hour on the name and one hour on the logo.</p>
<p>Why the time limit? Because it’s easy to get caught up in the branding phase, get all excited about an idea, and get attached.</p>
<p>It’s like finding a stray kitten. Once you name it and put a little collar on it, it will be way harder to give it up. And chances are, you may find when listening to your seed group, that this is not the right idea/market/kitten for you.</p>
<p>So don’t spend a ton of time and energy at this point getting your brand just right - it might change! And your goal for the next couple stages is to be open to that change, even welcoming of it.</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Changing our idea, or formulating our initial idea, based on market feedback, suggests we are actually listening and learning.</p>
<p><strong>Deliverable</strong></p>
<p>When you’re done, you should have an image file (could just be a screenshot) of your brand name with logo in your chosen font and color(s).</p>
<p>Don’t get too attached, but do have fun! Put on your creative hat, and get to branding!</p>
