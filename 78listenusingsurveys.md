<h3 id="learning-from-surveys">Learning from Surveys</h3>
<p>Surveys are a useful tool to get feedback and ideas from a lots of people at once. They can be used to find an answer to a specific question or to dig deeper into larger concepts.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovering New Ideas From a Market</li>
<li>Getting Insight About a Specific Feature or Solution</li>
<li>Pricing Discovery and Validation</li>
</ul>
<p>While this is not an exhaustive list, it’s a good starting point. A sample survey is provided below for each of the above examples.</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>Use surveys sparingly, as your list will quickly become fatigued if you send them too often. Send no more than one every three weeks to each person.</p>
<p>One way to get around this limitation is to send each new survey to a specific segment of your list (i.e. send one survey a week, but only send to people who joined within the past week).</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>If you need nuanced advice or you want to brainstorm a survey you’re thinking of sending, reach out in Discord.</p>
<h3 id="survey-template-discovering-new-ideas-from-a-market">Survey Template: Discovering New Ideas From a Market</h3>
<p>This is a general survey you can send to any niche list to start digging in to core problems faced by the market.</p>
<p><strong>Subject: Survey for HR Leaders</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q1:</strong>  What is the basic process you do in your job?</p>
<p><strong>Q2:</strong>  What is the biggest pain point in your process?</p>
<p><strong>Q3:</strong>  If you could wave a magic wand to solve your problems, what software would pop into existence? How would it make things better?</p>
<p><strong>Q4:</strong>  What solutions have you tried to solve this problem? Where did they fail?</p>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The Subject is designed to make HR folks feel special (HR is just an example market).</li>
<li>Since this survey has only open-ended questions, you might consider sending it directly by email.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="survey-template-getting-insight-about-a-specific-feature-or-solution">Survey Template: Getting Insight About a Specific Feature or Solution</h3>
<p>Surveys are an excellent way to help you get clarity about which specific feature your market cares about the most, and how they see it working:</p>
<p><strong>Subject: <a href="http://GetHappy.io">GetHappy.io</a> Enhancement Survey</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q1:</strong>  What feature interests you most about <a href="http://GetHappy.io">GetHappy.io</a>?</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability to set work goals for teams</li>
<li>Ability to auto-award goals and prizes</li>
<li>Ability to generate leaderboards for different groups</li>
<li>Ability to hook in to existing platforms like Slack &amp; Jira</li>
<li>Other: Please specify</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q2:</strong>  Why is that specific feature interesting?</p>
<p><strong>Q3:</strong>  In a perfect, world how would that feature solve your problem?</p>
<p><strong>Q4:</strong>  Anything else you think we should know?</p>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Imagine if 80% of respondents answered  <em>Ability to set work goals for teams</em>. It would bring real clarity that the center of the onion should be focused around helping companies achieve goals.</li>
<li>The subject is aimed at  <em>Super Seeds</em>  &amp;  <em>Followers</em>  to engage them in the idea that they have a say in the next big feature (which they do).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="survey-template-pricing-discovery-and-validation">Survey Template: Pricing Discovery and Validation</h3>
<p>This is a survey I created to run on Mechanical Turk. It worked very well as a price discovery survey. It would work well on any mailing list as long as the questions were updated to reflect the niche in question.</p>
<p><strong>Subject: Survey for Transcriptionists</strong></p>
<p>If there was an online professional (tax deductible) SaaS service for transcriptionists that cleaned up spoken audio files, removed hiss, scratches, normalized volume, and enhanced audio so that you could consistently hear what was being said…</p>
<p><strong>Q1:</strong>  Would it increase your transcription productivity? If so, how much?</p>
<ul>
<li>No Increase</li>
<li>5% Increase</li>
<li>10% Increase</li>
<li>15% Increase</li>
<li>20% Increase</li>
<li>25%+ Increase</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q2:</strong>  Would it increase your earnings? If so, how much?</p>
<ul>
<li>No Increase</li>
<li>5% Increase</li>
<li>10% Increase</li>
<li>15% Increase</li>
<li>20% Increase</li>
<li>25%+ Increase</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q3:</strong>  What would be the cheapest monthly rate a service like this could charge, yet still seem trustworthy and reliable?</p>
<ul>
<li>$0/month</li>
<li>$10/month</li>
<li><em>(Increase in $5 increments to $50)</em></li>
<li>$50+/month</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q4:</strong>  What would be the most expensive monthly rate a service like this could charge, that would be worth the earning increase?</p>
<ul>
<li>$0/month</li>
<li>$10/month</li>
<li><em>(Increase in $5 increments to $50)</em></li>
<li>$50+/month</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The first paragraph sells them on the value of the product before we ask them to consider price.</li>
<li>The first two questions help them quantify the value before we ask them to consider price.</li>
<li>The price questions are worded in such a way as to help them give the highest reasonable amount.</li>
</ul>
