<p>If you’re feeling buried under your list of possible ideas, good news - it’s time to start narrowing down that list!</p>
<p>Odds are, some ideas on your list are not right for you - possibly, not right for anyone!</p>
<p>In this stage, we’ll be axing ideas that won’t stand up to the physics of business, are drowned out by the existing competition, aren’t the right product type for you as a founder, or are too large and complex to be built as a bootstrapped startup.</p>
<p>There is good reason to do this work.  <strong><em>It will increase your chances of success!</em></strong></p>
