<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The physics of sales: customer, trust, product, persuasion</li>
<li>Ways to incorporate the physics of sales into a sales site</li>
</ul>

<p>If product sales was a molecule, it would be made of these atoms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/molecule-sales.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer</strong>: A person you think might buy your product.</li>
<li><strong>Product</strong>: The thing you want to sell.</li>
<li><strong>Trust</strong>: A rapport you build with your customer.</li>
<li><strong>Persuasion</strong>: An argument of value you present.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rule-of-sales">#1 Rule of Sales</h2>
<p><em>People buy from people (or<br>
companies) they know and trust.</em></p>
<h2 id="rule-of-sales-1">#2 Rule of Sales</h2>
<p><em>People buy products that solve<br>
their problem or make their life better.</em>_</p>
<h3 id="the-perfect-sales-process">The Perfect Sales Process</h3>
<p>I’ve listed the perfect sales process below. Something to keep in mind is that step two can, and should, take days if not weeks to complete.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pique someone’s interest (Persuasion)</li>
<li>Help them get to know and trust you (Trust)</li>
<li>Offer to solve their problem or make their life better (Persuasion)</li>
</ol>

<p>With all the beautiful sales pages in the world, one could be forgiven for thinking that is where the selling happens… When, for the most part, that is where the buying happens.</p>
<p><strong><em>Users almost never buy a product the first time they visit a sales page.</em></strong></p>
<p>In reality, they take a quick look. Go away and think about it. Do some research. Think some more. Talk to some friends. Research some more. Then, finally, come back and buy.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how that might play out:</p>
<p>Example Online Sales Journey</p>
<p>Day 1</p>
<ul>
<li>User gains awareness of a product.</li>
<li>User visits product sales page, has a quick look. [Persuasion]</li>
<li>User joins drip campaign. [Trust]</li>
</ul>
<p>Day 3</p>
<ul>
<li>User gets drip email. [Trust]</li>
<li>User looks at FAQ on product site. [Persuasion]</li>
<li>User asks friend if they have used the product. [Trust]</li>
</ul>
<p>Day 5</p>
<ul>
<li>User gets drip email. [Trust]</li>
<li>User reads some posts written by product creator. [Trust]</li>
<li>User reads some case studies on product site. [Trust]</li>
</ul>
<p>Day 7</p>
<ul>
<li>User goes back to sales page [Persuasion].</li>
<li>User takes note of 30 day money back guarantee. [Trust]</li>
<li>User makes purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>This a simplified version of how effective sales works. Take a moment to note all of the touch points that build trust and apply persuasion.</p>
<p>Essentially, we’re building  <em>Trust &amp; Persuasion Surface Area</em>  over time.</p>
<h3 id="the-many-tentacles-of-online-sales">The Many Tentacles of Online Sales</h3>
<p>A fully functioning online sales machine has a lot of moving parts that all work together.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/octopus.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The basic sales machine consists of these three components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A product that solves a problem for a market we know how to reach</li>
<li>A sales site with clear, concise, value-driven copy</li>
<li>Highly relevant traffic directed to the sales site</li>
</ol>
<p>A larger sales machine is made up of many moving parts that work in harmony:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Product</li>
<li>Sales Site</li>
<li>Landing Pages</li>
<li>Drip Campaigns</li>
<li>Content Marketing</li>
<li>Email Marketing</li>
<li>Paid Marketing</li>
<li>Social Media</li>
<li>Videos</li>
<li>Webinars</li>
<li>Podcasts</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>When taken together they form  <em>the whole product</em>.</p>
<p>For example, a customer may come into contact with any one of these things at any time. At that moment that  <em>individual thing</em>  will either build, or erode, trust for  <em>the whole product</em>.</p>
<p>As business owner, we must learn how to orchestrate all of these moving parts into a unified whole. All working together to bring a customer from the outside to the inside. To grow trust and persuade a customer to take a chance on us, buy our product, and tell other people how great it is.</p>
<p><em>That</em>  is the physics of sales.</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>In the next lesson we will continue with the theory of persuasion. After that, we will focus on building our sales site. However, please do  <strong><em>keep the physics of sales in mind</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Ultimately we will be exploring and building a multifaceted sales machine. We will be adding new moving parts to the machine as we push closer to Stage 12, and ultimately, launch.</p>
