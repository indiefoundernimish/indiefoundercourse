<p>In the action response box, write down the seed group growth strategies you intend to use.</p>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>You’ve explored five seed group strategies in this stage. Don’t worry - there’s no need to do all of them! But, you’ll definitely need to do at least one or two to form your initial seed group.</p>
<p>The main thing to keep in mind is  <strong><em>we need at least 5-10 Super Seeds to move forward with any idea.</em></strong></p>
<p>Take a minute to reflect on a few factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Product type</li>
<li>The Market</li>
<li>What you have time for</li>
<li>What you feel comfortable with</li>
<li>The Super Seed ratio for each strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>Look back at each of the four strategies, and see how many factors fit. After some analysis, go ahead and select at least one or two strategies!</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>You don’t need to  <em>implement</em>  these strategies yet - just pick the ones that are right for you. Your goal in Stage 7 will be to use these strategies to build a seed group of potential customers, conduct interviews in which you listen and learn from them, and exit the stage with a defined and validated product idea!</p>
