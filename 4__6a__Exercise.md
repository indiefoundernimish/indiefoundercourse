<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>It’s decision time again. You’ve got your product/founder fit score. You’ve got your lean canvases. You’ve got your feedback from the group. Now, you’ve got two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify your favorite of the three ideas!</li>
<li>Identify the market you want to explore to find an even better idea!</li>
</ol>
<p>Either option above can work. If you’re especially pumped about one idea, great! But if all of your ideas are leaning toward the same market, or if you’re more excited by a particular market than an exact idea, it might be best to leave the actual idea for later. The market will tell you what they want!</p>
<p><em>Hint</em></p>
<p>Note, if you go with Option 1, this idea may not be the one you end up building! The next three stages will focus on talking to the market. If it turns out this idea isn’t what people really want, you may be revising the idea until it’s right, or revisiting this short list of three and trying again. And that’s ok! We’ll learn more about why it’s important to #FailFast in Stage 7, but for now, be brave, get excited, and pick your way forward: idea or market!</p>
