<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Why analyzing your goals is an important part of building your product/founder fit.</li>
<li>How to use your goals to create your roadmap to success.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I first start talking to a new Nugget member, I ask them “What are your goals?”</p>
<p>Many times when they respond, they say something like “I haven’t really thought about it,” or “I’m just trying to earn some extra cash.”</p>
<p><em>Well, if we don’t know where we’re going, there’s a 100% chance we won’t get there!</em></p>
<p>There are many reasons why setting goals is a very good idea. However, I think the most powerful reason is that a goal can give us a roadmap.</p>
<p>I’ve outlined a powerful process to do that, below, called backward planning.</p>
<h3 id="backward-planning">Backward Planning</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/kickass/images/backward.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We can create a step-by-step roadmap to our goal if we plan backward.</p>
<p>Let’s use this example of a developer wanting to start his first side project. We’ll call him Joe.</p>
<p><em>Joe’s Goal</em></p>
<p>Joe wants to spend all day with his kids instead of at his day job.</p>
<h4 id="backward-planning-1">Backward Planning</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to leave his day job, Joe needs to replace his income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To do that, he needs to make $10k per month revenue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To do that, he could earn $10k/month from SaaS subscriptions using one of the following models:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell a $10 monthly subscription to 1000 people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell a $200 monthly subscription to 50 people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell a $50 monthly subscription to 200 people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He reflects on these options and decides:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selling to 1000 customers feels like a really big mountain to climb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selling a $200 monthly product still seems a bit too high for his first project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He thinks he could sell a $50 subscription to 200 people.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To do that, Joe needs to find a niche he likes, where the users can afford the $50 price-point. He considers professional photographers, since he loves photography.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To do that, Joe could to start a mailing list that helps professional photographers. Then he could reach out to them, find out what problems they have, and sell them stuff based on the problems they tell him about. Note, he may or may not have an initial idea of what they want. Either way, talking to the market will lead him in the right direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s say Joe builds an email list with 2k professional photographers. If he can convert 10% of those to a $50/month subscription, he can hit his goal!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All he needs is 5 new email subscribers, every day for one year, to build his 2k big list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To do that, he needs to make an email capture page for professional photographers. If he offers something awesome (like a free ebook) in return for the user’s email address, his page could have a high conversion rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a 10% conversion rate, he’d need to get 50 people per day to his email capture page to get 5 emails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe can do that by starting a blog for professional photographers and writing great content for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To write great content for professional photographers, he first needs to find out what burning questions they have… and how to answer them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To do that, he can hang out at professional photographer forums, taking note of burning questions people ask and the best answers they get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, he can copy/paste those questions and answers and use them as raw material for his free ebook and blog posts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There you go! And that, at a very high level, is the type of process you’ll be going through in Stages 6 and 7. But it all starts here, with setting your goals and figuring out your product/founder fit.</p>

<p>Purposefully designing your day-to-day experience is just as important as setting your goals.  <strong><em>Lifestyle Design should be taken into account when axing or keeping ideas on your list.</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="how-do-you-want-to-live-each-day">How do you want to live each day?</h4>
<p>Here are some guiding questions to help you consider how some product ideas may affect your day-to-day:</p>
<ul>
<li>How critical do you want your app to be to your customers? If it is highly critical, you may need to offer 24/7 support and always be available to fix downtime day or night. Do you care about that kind of pressure?</li>
<li>Building on top of a platform like Facebook or Twitter means you will need to continually update your codebase to keep up with their APIs. Do you mind that?</li>
<li>What types of customers do you want to work with? This takes us back to founder/market fit, but it can definitely impact your lifestyle. Will your product be supporting business executives, new parents, people with a unique hobby? Who you’re supporting will impact the tone and content of your day-to-day communications.</li>
<li>Do you see yourself independently maintaining the product long term, or will you need a team if it grows? Would you enjoy working with other developers, marketers, etc., or are you hoping to stick to the lone-wolf route for your lifestyle?</li>
</ul>
