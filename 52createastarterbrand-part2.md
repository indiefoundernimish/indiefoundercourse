<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a brand logo for your landing page and outreach efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you are still exploring a market and don’t have a product hypothesis just yet, don’t worry. You can make a generic brand and landing page for your market, and evolve it as a product idea emerges.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/logos.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I created each of the above logos in 30 minutes using a very simple three-step process. I will explain the process below. But first…</p>
<h4 id="why-make-a-logo">Why Make a Logo?</h4>
<p>Like a brand name, we don’t  <em>need</em>  a logo to validate our idea,  <em>but</em>  it is nice to have a logo for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It helps bring our idea to life and makes it feel more real to us and the people we talk to.</li>
<li>It helps us feel more confident when we talk about our idea with potential customers.</li>
<li>It makes our landing page look more professional and trustable, which in turn increases email signups.</li>
<li>It’s fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, there’s something about having a semi-decent logo that brings a sense of legitimacy and confidence to our validation efforts.</p>
<h4 id="what-makes-a-good--starter-brand--logo">What Makes a Good  STARTER BRAND  Logo?</h4>
<p>Firstly, a starter brand logo does not need to be good with a capital G. Here are a few world-class logos. We don’t need to stress and try to make something  <em>this</em>  good:</p>

<p>The logos below are  <em>perfectly fine</em>  for a starter brand:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/logos.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, the cynical answer to “What makes a good starter brand logo?” is “anything.” But a more considered answer is “A logo that supports our validation efforts.”</p>
<p>Or, more specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not embarrassing!</li>
<li>It doesn’t suck!</li>
<li>It looks like it could be a “real” thing!</li>
</ul>
<p>The quickest, easiest, and cheapest way I’ve found to do all of that is to use the three-step process detailed in the rest of this lesson.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-make-a-starter-brand-logo-in-three-steps">How to Make a Starter Brand Logo in Three Steps</h4>
<p>The method I use consists of these three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step #1:</strong>  Pick a font that suits your brand idea using  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Step #2:</strong>  Pick some flat icons that suit your brand idea using  <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/">Flaticon</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Step #3:</strong>  Combine them in  <a href="https://moqups.com/">Moqups</a>  and try out different colors and letter spacing until you find something you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-pick-a-font-that-suits-your-brand-idea">Step #1: Pick a Font That Suits Your Brand Idea</h4>
<ol>
<li>Head on over to  <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>  and type your brand idea on top of the sample font text.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example with the brand idea “happy”:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/gfonts-1.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Make the text bigger by dragging the font sizer (up to 70px-90px)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click “APPLY TO ALL FONTS”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/gfonts-2.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Scroll through until you find a font that just looks  <em>right</em>  - something that already looks “like a logo” right there on the page.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Try turning off all font types apart from “Display” and “Handwriting” to only show fonts with lots of character.</li>
<li>Try different capitalization variants such as “Happy” or “HAPPY.” Remember to use the “apply to all fonts” option.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>When you find something you like, take note of the font name. We will use it in Step 3.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, I liked the font “Bad Script” with a capital H variant of Happy.</p>

<h4 id="step-2-pick-some-flat-icons-that-suit-your-brand-idea">Step #2: Pick Some Flat Icons That Suit Your Brand Idea</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Head on over to  <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/">Flaticon</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the search options to “Monocolor” and “Filled”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s hard to go wrong if the icon is filled and only one color. All icons like that are very simple by default.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Search with keywords related to your brand idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you see a few you icons you like, download them as .svg’s (we’ll use SVG because it never pixelates).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note 1</em></p>
<p>When you download a mono-color icon, you can choose the color to download it as. Set it to something you like!</p>
<p><em>Note 2</em></p>
<ul>
<li>For the brand idea  <em>Happy</em> , I searched with the keyword “happy”. In the results, I liked  <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/happy_151974">this icon</a>. It seemed somewhat unique and interesting.</li>
<li>For a related keyword, I searched with the word “sun”. In the results, I liked  <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/bright-sun_2763">this icon</a>. It also seemed interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note 3</em></p>
<p>If you don’t have a paid Flaticon account, you shoud give credit for the logo use. Consider adding credit in the footer of your website.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-combine-the-font-and-icons-and-play-with-them">Step #3: Combine the Font and Icons and Play With Them</h4>
<ol>
<li>Head on over to  <a href="https://moqups.com/">Moqups</a>  and create a free account or use the “Try it now for free” option to open a blank page.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>You will need a $13/month subscription to export from Moqups. If you have another art program that you regularly use, follow along in that program.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Click “Stencils” icon (on the left) and drag a “Heading” item onto the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double-click the heading and change it to the name of your brand idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the heading is selected, and click the format icon (top right). Change the font to the one you liked. Do that by typing in the font name in the text style box. Also set the font size to something big like 120.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/moqups-1.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Click the “images” icon on the left, upload your SVG files, and drag them on to the page.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/moqups-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note: I set the color of the SVG’s when I downloaded them from Flaticon.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Play with the positioning and letter spacing. For each new variant, copy/paste and try something different.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/moqups-3.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Copy/paste the one you like on to a new blank page and export it as a .png with “selected page,” “trim contents to bounds,” and “transparent background” checked.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/moqups-4.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>I started off liking the capital H variant, but when I played with it in Moqups and applied letter spacing, the lower case variant seemed to work much better.</p>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If you need help coming up with a good color combination I recommend the tool  <a href="http://paletton.com/">Paletton</a>.</li>
<li>You don’t need to use Moqups for this process. You can use your favorite art editor if you already have one you prefer.</li>
<li>There are services that enable you to make logos with a drag-drop interface such as  <a href="https://logojoy.com/">Logojoy</a>. Personally, I don’t find them to be as flexible as the above method, but they still work well.</li>
<li>Again, there’s nothing wrong with creating a logo as you start to explore a market instead of a speficic idea. It can help you establish your identity and presence in the market, and evolve over time.</li>
</ul>
