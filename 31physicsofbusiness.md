<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The immutable formula behind all profitable product businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/physics-of-business.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="profitable-product-business-molecule"><strong><em>Profitable Product Business Molecule</em></strong></h4>
<p>If a profitable product business was a molecule, it would be made of these atoms:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/molecule.png" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You:</strong>  That’s you/your business.</li>
<li><strong>Product:</strong>  The thing you sell at a profit.</li>
<li><strong>Intent to pay:</strong>  The customer’s desire to give you money.</li>
<li><strong>Customers:</strong>  The people you sell your product to.</li>
</ul>
<p>If  <strong><em>any</em></strong>  of those atoms are missing, the integrity of the molecule breaks down, and there can be no profitable product business.</p>
<h4 id="successful-business-stack"><strong><em>Successful Business Stack</em></strong></h4>
<p>Another way I like to think about this is as a layer cake. I call this the  <strong><em>Successful Business Stack</em></strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s explore through the lens of “the stack”.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bottom layer is  <strong>customers</strong>. They are the foundation of every product business. If we don’t have customers, we don’t have a business.</li>
<li>The second layer is  <strong>intent to pay</strong>. Without customer intent to pay, we can’t make money.</li>
<li>The third layer is  <strong>product</strong>. Without a profitable product, there is nothing to sell to the customers.</li>
<li>The top layer is  <strong>you</strong>. Without you, there is nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Just like with the molecule diagram, you need all the layers to work, or there can be no profitable product business.</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="guessing--messing"><strong><em>Guessing &amp; Messing</em></strong></h4>
<p>I call the top two layers of the stack “Guessing &amp; Messing.”</p>
<p>If we spend all our time in the top two layers, we  <em>can</em>  build a product, but  <strong><em>we can’t build a profitable business.</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack-top.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Many founders fall into this trap.</p>
<ul>
<li>They get the madness about an idea.</li>
<li>They spend months building it, but they never speak to any customers.</li>
<li>Finally, one day, they release it to a loud thud of silence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>At best, this is nothing more than a gamble and a guess.</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="learning--earning"><strong><em>Learning &amp; Earning</em></strong></h4>
<p>I call the bottom two layers “Learning &amp; Earning.”</p>
<p>If the top two layers are where all the fun is at, the bottom two layers are where the learning is at.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack-bottom.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong><em>It’s only by learning from our customers that we can truly make what they want and start earning.</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="the-immutable-formula-for-success"><strong><em>The Immutable Formula for Success</em></strong></h4>
<p>Just so there isn’t any room for doubt, I want to spell out what this all means and how it adds up to an immutable formula for success.</p>
<p><strong>Customers</strong>  (i.e. You grow an audience.)</p>
<p><code>+</code></p>
<p><strong>Intent to Pay</strong>  (i.e. You learn what they want.)</p>
<p><code>+</code></p>
<p><strong>Product</strong>  (i.e. You build what they want.)</p>
<p><code>+</code></p>
<p><strong>You</strong>  (i.e. You make it all happen.)</p>
<p><code>=</code></p>
<p><strong>Successful Product Business</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Just like death and taxes, it’s unavoidable. Every successful product (or service) business has to abide by these rules.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Examples</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DropBox</strong>: They’ve grown an audience who want easy storage between devices. They make and sell easy storage between devices.</li>
<li><strong>Basecamp</strong>: They’ve grown an audience who wants an easy-to-use project management tool. They make and sell an easy-to-use project management tool.</li>
<li><strong>Coke</strong>: They’ve grown an audience of people who want sweet fizzy drinks. They make and sell sweet fizzy drinks.</li>
<li><strong>Nugget</strong>: I’ve grown an audience of people who want to start a profitable side project. I make and sell training that teaches how to do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way of saying this is  <strong><em>Product/Market Fit</em></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="absolute-clarity">Absolute Clarity</h3>
<p>It helps us evaluate the merit of what we’re working on, with absolute clarity.</p>
<p>We know that if our project doesn’t have all the atoms required for a successful product business, we need to change something.</p>
<p>We know that if we’ve only been working in the top two layers of the stack, we need to change something.</p>
<p>Most of all, we know beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this…</p>
<p><strong>Customers</strong>  (i.e. You grow an audience.)</p>
<p><code>+</code></p>
<p><strong>Intent to Pay</strong>  (i.e. You learn what they want.)</p>
<p><code>+</code></p>
<p><strong>Product</strong>  (i.e. You build what they want.)</p>
<p><code>+</code></p>
<p><strong>You</strong>  (i.e. You make it all happen.)</p>
<p><code>=</code></p>
<p><strong>Successful Product Business</strong></p>
<p>…represents the fundamental physics of every successful product business.</p>
<p><strong><em>We know that if we want one, this is exactly what we’re going to have to do.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>In Summary</em></p>
<p>You can approach your market with an existing idea, or you can let the market tell you what they want.</p>
<p><strong><em>Either way, the stack dictates that customers should come first, long before a product is created.</em></strong></p>
