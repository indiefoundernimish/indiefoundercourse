<h3 id="why-sketch-out-your-product-blueprint">Why Sketch Out Your Product Blueprint?</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve mapped our customer validation into the perfect Little Snowball, we’ll need to get started on the process of turning it into a  <em>real thing</em>. To do that, the best first step we can take is create a blueprint which will act as the foundation of our  <em>building work</em>.</p>
<p>When I first started coding in '94, people used to plan software by creating lengthy  <a href="https://technologyconversations.com/2014/01/10/software-development-models-waterfall/">waterfall</a>  specification and functional documents. This process took weeks if not months just to  <em>define</em>  the software.</p>
<p>With Hyper Iteration in mind, I’ve developed a process that does something similar, but takes just a few hours to create the following key blueprint documents:</p>
<p><strong>Product Blueprint</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A skeleton Mind Map that defines the structure of our product</li>
<li>A set of lo-fi mockups to visualize our product</li>
<li>A written description for each mockup (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once we have these simple documents, we can use them to show anyone who needs to understand our vision (developers, co-founders, etc.).</p>
<p>The documents also serve as our foundational reference moving forward.</p>
<p><em>Important Note</em></p>
<p>As we create our blueprint, we must remain vigilant about keeping things small. Nothing should end up in our first set of plans that is not absolutely critical. In other words,  <strong><em>we’re also drafting a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</em></strong>.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-sketch-your-product-blueprint-mvp">How to Sketch your Product Blueprint MVP</h3>
<p>This process can be done in a few hours and consists of the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step #1:</strong>  Create a skeleton Mind Map that defines the structure of your product</p>
<p><strong>Step #2:</strong>  Create a lo-fi mockup for each page</p>
<p><strong>Step #3:</strong>  Create a written description for each page (optional)</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Depending on your product type, the following steps may need to be adapted, but the principle remains the same. Now is the time to create a blueprint. It could be a content outline, a detailed list of services with examples, etc. Think about it from a customer perspective - what exactly will your customers experience? Use the next few lessons and actions to create a blueprint of that experience!</p>

<hr>
<p>The foundation of our product blueprint is a skeleton Mind Map which will define our product.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this was the original Mind Map of the Happy Little Snowball:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-06-14-160757.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next up, we need to step back and think about our Little Snowball through the lens of software screens.</p>
<p>Since all software products start from the main nav down, essentially we just need to create a navigation hierarchy in Mind Map form.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I created a new Mind Map and noted that the center was the main navigation with each top level item being a main navigation item:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-06-15-155331.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Another way to think about this would be to imagine website navigation links looking like this:</p>
<p><strong><em>Logged Out</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Login</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Logged In</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dashboard</li>
<li>Leaderboard</li>
<li>Account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Logged In as Admin</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dashboard</li>
<li>Leaderboard</li>
<li>Account</li>
<li>Admin</li>
</ul>
<p>I listed the minimum number of screens that it might take to make the Happy product work and organized them in a sensible hierarchy starting from the main navigation outward.</p>
<p>In other words, if someone logged in the Happy website, they would see the main dashboard and would have a main navigation that looked like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dashboard</li>
<li>Leaderboard</li>
<li>Admin</li>
<li>Account</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, when they hovered over those items, they might see the sub nav options shown in the above Mind Map.</p>
<p>Also note, I added a page icon next to each item that needs to be mocked up as a screen. There are 13 screens in total.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-create-a-lo-fi-mockup-for-each-page">Step #2: Create a lo-fi mockup for each page</h4>
<hr>
<p>Following on from our work in the lesson  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/stage/7/step/10">Learn how and why to mock up your best guess solution</a>, we can now create a very light mockup for each page.</p>
<p>Each of these mockups should be simple and only include the specific features we need for that page.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the <a href="http://GetHappty.io">GetHappty.io</a> dashboard mocked up. Looking back at the Mind Map, we can see that the two components of the Dashboard are the Goals Summary and Leaderboard Summary, so I’ve created a rough visual of the page with those components below.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-13-102859.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When we are finished, we will have a set of mockups that visibly display the core features of our product in an intuitive and easy-to-understand way.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-create-a-written-description-for-each-page-optional">Step #3: Create a written description for each page (optional)</h4>
<hr>
<p>You’ve created the visuals, so of course they make sense to you. But what if you need to share them? Or, what if you haven’t fully thought through how something will work, and a connection is missing?</p>
<p>When creating a written description of your pages, you’ll want to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What should be the most important elements on the page?</li>
<li>Where does the information on the page come from?</li>
<li>How does the user get to the page?</li>
<li>How does the user interact with the page? I.e., what can the user click on, and what happens?</li>
</ul>
<p>Take another look at the visual of the Happy Dashboard as an example. The brief written description below goes a long way to explain the functionality. Without this explanation or more detailed sketches, it may not be clear where the information on the page comes from or how the user interacts with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-13-102859.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Written explanation of Happy Dashboard</p>
<ul>
<li>The user lands directly on this page upon login. They can also get to this page from the Dashboard option in their navigation.</li>
<li>The most important elements on the page are the Goals and Leaderboard.</li>
<li>The Goals are set on the Admin page. See sketch and written description of Admin page for details on adding/editing goals and assigning users.</li>
<li>The user can click on a Goal to change its status in an expandable area. Marking a Goal as complete adds a point to the user’s Leaderboard score.</li>
<li>The Leaderboard shows the top five users in the user’s organization based on their Leaderboard score. Users from other organizations do not appear. Users can manage their names and profile pictures on the Account &gt; Profile page.</li>
<li>Clicking on a user in the Leaderboard opens a profile popup to show the user’s bio and recently Goals completed. Users can add their bio on the Account &gt; Profile page. Goals are set and assigned to the user on the Admin page, and only Goals that the selected user has marked as Complete appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, by writing out the description, it may become clear that you need to sketch out a missing piece. In this case, the expandable Goals status area and the profile popup could use a visual sketch, or else be chopped from the MVP if possible.</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>After we have created this set of documentation - our product blueprint - we will be in a strong position to explain our idea to developers, designers, investors, and anyone else who needs to get insight into our product vision.</p>
