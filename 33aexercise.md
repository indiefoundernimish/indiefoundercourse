<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ul>
<li>Take another look at your list of ideas, and if you haven’t already done so, identify the market types you’d be serving.</li>
<li>For each market type, think through the possible unique pros and cons.</li>
<li>Axe ideas with a market type that will make it too difficult for you to succeed with your current resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>When considering market pros and cons, think about sales cycle length, compliance with government regulations, who specifically you’d be selling to in the market, and how you’d reach this market segment.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, just because a market might be challenging doesn’t mean you  <em>have</em>  to discard it. If it’s something you’re passionate about and you have the resources (time, money, knowledge) to pursue, then by all means, keep it on the list! If it’s not the right fit for you, it should be clear by the end of Stage 4.</p>
