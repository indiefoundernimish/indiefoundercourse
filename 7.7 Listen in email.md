<h3 id="validation-via-email">Validation via Email</h3>
<p>Validation via email is not as deep as spoken interviews or even Slack discussions. However, it has its place and is an especially useful tool under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preliminary validation using cold outreach</li>
<li>Getting a larger number of YES validations to confirm our main findings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preliminary-validation-using-cold-outreach">Preliminary Validation Using Cold Outreach</h3>
<p>There have been times when I’ve been a bit skeptical of an idea, but I still liked it. In those cases, rather than spending a lot of time setting up and running full-on customers interviews, I decided to take a shortcut.</p>
<p>I used cold outreach methods to send out a single-shot email with some light validation questions. This enabled me to get a sense of how excited the market was about my product idea in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>As shown in  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/stage/6/step/6">Stage 6: Learn how to build your seed group with email cold outreach</a>, there is an example of this kind of email:</p>
<p><strong>Example Email</strong></p>
<p>Subject: Feedback about HR</p>
<p>Hi {{firstName}},</p>
<p>I came across your profile on LinkedIn, and was impressed by your recruitment experience at {{company}}. That’s why I’m reaching out.</p>
<p>I am an entrepreneur and software developer.</p>
<p>I’m investigating the idea of building a platform that would enable IT recruiters like you to find out if a candidate actively wanted to be recruited vs did not want to be contacted.</p>
<p>It would be a search engine you could use to discover a candidates preferences. IE If they were actively looking, what salary they wanted, what role they wanted, etc. Or if they did not want to receive any cold emails from recruiters. A bit like a marketing do not call list.</p>
<p>Also, the system would show you that information as you browsed around LinkedIn using a chrome extension.</p>
<p>If such a platform existed would that help you? Do you think your firm would honor the “do not send email” aspect of it?</p>
<p>All thoughts you might have about this idea would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for your time!</p>

<h3 id="getting-a-larger-number-of-yes-validations-to-confirm-our-main-findings">Getting a Larger Number of YES Validations to Confirm Our Main Findings</h3>
<p>If we want to be  <em>extra sure</em>  our idea is good after we’ve validated it with our Super Seeds, we can run it past our larger email list.</p>
<p>Just send an email like the one shown below to your full list or a subset of folks that you have interacted with on your list.</p>
<p><strong>Example Email</strong></p>
<p>Subject: Looking for your feedback</p>
<p>Hi {{firstName}},</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>Ok, so I’ve spoken to lot’s of people about <a href="http://GetHappy.io">GetHappy.io</a> and these are the final features that we’re thinking about including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature 1</li>
<li>Feature 2</li>
<li>Feature 3</li>
</ul>
<p>These features have been shortlisted based on X discussions with X HR folks.</p>
<p>Does it sound like they will begin to solve some of your problems around staff retention? Is there anything else we could do that would be better?</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!</p>

<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>This may not be a foolproof solution because there could be people on our list who joined before we discovered our core value proposition. Still, it can be a great bonus validation step if we want some extra assurance.</p>
