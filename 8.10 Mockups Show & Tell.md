<h1 id="mockups-show--tell">Mockups Show &amp; Tell</h1>
<h3 id="show-it-off">Show it off!</h3>
<p>It’s time to share your mockups! Consider sharing both your blueprint sketches and your hi-fi designs for context.</p>
<p>Guiding Questions</p>
<ul>
<li>How do your hi-fi designs compare to your blueprints? Is there anything in that transition that surprised you?</li>
<li>Did you outsource or create your own designs? Anything to share about that process?</li>
<li>If you’re working on a product type without hi-fi designs, how did you apply the blueprint concept to your work?</li>
<li>What has your ongoing seed group feedback been during this stage?</li>
</ul>
