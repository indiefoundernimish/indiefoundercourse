<h1 id="use-this-algorithm-to-shorten-your-list">Use this algorithm to shorten your list</h1>
<p>_  If you have any questions about this action, ask us in Discord, we will answer there and add to an FAQ here._</p>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>Use the below algorithm to score each idea on your list and remove ideas with scores of 0-3.</p>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Here you go, a simple binary algorithm. Think of it as a five-step true/false question. Is it an exact science? No. Will it save you hours of wondering about (or months of building!) a bad-fit idea? Definitely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal: 0/1</li>
<li>Pricing: 0/1</li>
<li>Product: 0/1</li>
<li>Customers: 0/1</li>
<li>Market: 0/1</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the remaining ideas on your list, you’ll use this algorithm to assign a score of 0-5. Each of the five product/founder fit facets is worth one point.</p>
<p>For example, consider an idea that aligns with your personality and personal goals (Personal = 1), your needed pricing structure (Pricing = 1), and your desired product type (Product = 1), but it doesn’t serve the type of customers you want to work with (Customer = 0) and relies on a market that is too small or saturated (Market = 0). This idea would score a 3 out of 5. It has some strengths, but it’s definitely not a bullseye.</p>
<p>If you need help determining if an idea is the right fit for your facets, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal - Does it fit with your lifestyle, passions, available time, and personal goals?</li>
<li>Pricing - Does it fit with a price point that could add up to your desired monthly revenue?</li>
<li>Product - Does it fit with the product type you’re best suited to build?</li>
<li>Customers - Does it fit with the type and amount of customers you want to work with?</li>
<li>Market - Does it fit with the type, size, and saturation of market you’re comfortable serving?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>If you are a non technical founder, for the product question, interpret it as “Can I outsource this easily or will it be extremely complicated to do that?” Your best guess, gut feel is fine.</p>
