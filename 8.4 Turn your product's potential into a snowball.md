<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>How to distill and refine your grand vision into a little snowball.</li>

<h3 id="minimum-viable-product-vs-little-snowball">Minimum Viable Product vs Little Snowball</h3>
<p>What I call a Little Snowball is somewhat equivalent to what others call a Minimum Viable Product:</p>
<p>A minimum viable product (MVP) is a development technique in which a new product or website is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters. The final, complete set of features is only designed and developed after considering feedback from the product’s initial users.</p>
<p>There is a difference though.</p>
<p>What I mean by Little Snowball is the  <em>essence of the business</em>. A Little Snowball can still have a Minimum Viable Product. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uber’s Little Snowball</strong>  = Order a Cab Using an App</li>
<li><strong>Uber’s MVP</strong>  = Barebones App, with a Simple PHP Backend</li>
</ul>
<p>In this lesson, we are learning how to uncover the Little Snowball.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, we will learn how to sketch out the Minimum Viable Product based on the Little Snowball</p>
<h3 id="how-to-find-the-little-snowball">How to Find the Little Snowball</h3>
<p>We’ve already spoken at length about why  <strong><em>“small is good”</em></strong>  and why  <strong><em>“do one thing well”</em></strong>  is your best business strategy. So, I’ll take it as a given you’re already sold on those ideas.</p>
<p>Now, we need to explore exactly how to turn your product’s full potential into a little snowball. To begin that process, let me start by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"Your Customers Don’t Know Everything"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you read that right! After everything we’ve been through, I bet you never thought you would hear those words from me.</p>
<p>The hard truth is this:</p>
<p>The ultimate responsibly of deciding what your little snowball is rests on  <em>your</em>  shoulders, not your customers.</p>
<p>Can you believe it? After all this customer learning, we still need to be the ones to decide what we’re going to build!</p>
<p>Yes, it’s true that each Super Seed has told us about their problems. And also true that we have validated a product idea they want to pay for…  <em>but</em>  we are now armed with extra knowledge that goes beyond any one discussion with any one Super Seed.</p>
<p>Because, between all of our customer discussions, we’ve probably uncovered more than one possible direction. Now  <strong><em>we need to zone in on doing one thing well</em></strong>, so we’ll we need to look at our Mind Map and ask ourselves some key questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What one thing is the center of this onion?</li>
<li>What one thing will help the most customers… the most?</li>
<li>What one thing will take the least amount of effort to get into the marketplace?</li>
<li>What one thing has the best revenue potential?</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, your little snowball will become clear after you ask those questions. Your next step is to make a new version of your mind map with all the unrelated items deleted. But first…</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-if-your-little-snowball-is-not-obvious">What Happens if your Little Snowball is Not Obvious?</h3>
<p>In some cases, it’s not clear exactly what the little snowball is, so you might have to dig a little deeper.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say I spoke to 20 Super Seeds about Happy. Ten of them were excited about the  <em>Employee Handbook Creator</em>. Ten were excited about a  <em>Task Manager</em>.</p>

<p>What should I make my little snowball?</p>
<p>To decide, I would need to do a deep dive and ask myself some additional questions. Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all set of additional questions. With regard to this specific 10/10 split case for Happy, here are the questions I would be asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the results skew one way or another if company sizes were &lt; 10 employees?</li>
<li>Did customers seem more willing to pay for the  <em>Employee Handbook Creator</em>  or the  <em>Task Manager</em>?</li>
<li>Did customers seem to have more pain around needing the  <em>Employee Handbook Creator</em>  or the  <em>Task Manager</em>?</li>
<li>What are the price points I can charge for  <em>Employee Handbook Creator</em>  vs. the  <em>Task Manager</em>?</li>
<li>Which customer type will it be easier for me to acquire?</li>
<li>Which one of these two little snowballs excites me more?</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy - The Little Snowball</p>
<hr>
<p>For the purpose of this exercise, let’s say the  <em>Task Manager</em>  came out on top based on the above questions.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I reworked the full-potential Mind Map by removing all the items that are not part of the  <em>Task Manager</em>  core idea. The end result is a little snowball based around a task manager with  <em>Goals</em>  and  <em>Prizes</em>. This is a very manageable feature set, which we’ll continue to explore as  <em>blueprints</em>  in the next lesson.</p>

<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>You may discover the original idea you validated is no longer the center of the onion. If that is the case, you can go back through the  branding exercise  in Stage 5 and make sure your new brand matches the new center of the onion. You may need to update your landing page as well, but don’t get too hung up on that step. We’ll focus on your website in more detail in Stage 9.</p>
<p>In this case, the existing Happy brand continues to work.</p>
