<h4 id="example-of-validating-an-idea-by-email-only">Example of Validating an Idea by Email Only</h4>
<p>So far we’ve spoken about using email cold outreach to set up customer interviews, which is definitely the most effective way to run a deep customer development campaign.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes we might want to opt for a shortcut, to dip our toe in the water and see if we can get a head start on validating an idea directly by email.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is a real campaign I sent out to validate  <a href="https://nugget.one/nugget/232">Nugget #232: Recruitment do-not-call list</a>. As a bonus, I’ve included 5 real responses.</p>
<p><em>Example Email</em></p>
<pre><code>Subject: Feedback about HR

Hi {{firstName}},

I came across your profile on LinkedIn, and was impressed by your recruitment experience at {{company}}. That's why I'm reaching out.

I am an entrepreneur and software developer.

I'm investigating the idea of building a platform that would enable IT recruiters like you to find out if a candidate actively wanted to be recruited vs did not want to be contacted.

It would be a search engine you could use to discover a candidate's preferences. IE If they were actively looking, what salary they wanted, what role they wanted, etc. Or if they did not want to receive any cold emails from recruiters. A bit like a marketing do not call list.

Also, the system would show you that information as you browsed around LinkedIn using a chrome extension.

If such a platform existed would that help you? Do you think your firm would honor the "do not send email" aspect of it?

All thoughts you might have about this idea would be very much appreciated.

Many thanks in advance for your time!

<h4 id="response-1">Response #1</h4>
<p><em>Thanks for reaching out. While I like your idea, I think there is one challenge and that is the “Do Not Call” list. The list for your telephone number only works because it is mandated by law. Salespeople wouldn’t honor it if they didn’t have to.<br>
I will say that if someone has on their LinkedIn profile, “Recruiters, please don’t contact me” I will not send them an inmail because it costs money every time I send them. But many agencies “spam people” for lack of a better term. Our candidate database allows us to send 1000s of emails at once to every person in our list if we wanted to. My company does not work that way but for many agencies, it is a volume business. If you were to market something like this, it would have to figure out how this would lead to more hires for recruiter. How it would create a better hit rate and how it is different from Job Boards.</em></p>
<h4 id="response-2">Response #2</h4>
<p><em>Yes I think that would be useful to a certain degree. Problem is that I have placed many candidates who “were not looking” and I drew out their interest. But I guess it is good to know who would be easier to connect with.</em></p>
<h4 id="response-3">Response #3</h4>
<p><em>I like the Idea but honestly i wouldn’t honor the do not contact aspect.</em></p>
<h4 id="response-4">Response #4</h4>
<p><em>Short answer, yes of course, that type of add-on / extension would be very interesting. Yes I think most would honor the do not contact, but there will always be those that don’t.<br>
Here’s your problem, (the problem of all software), adoption. You can write the very best software in the world, but if no one uses it….then it won’t succeed and achieve adoption. So marketing will be necessary, the web is a ‘big’ place and you have to help people find the ‘gems’ that will impact their lives.</em></p>
<h4 id="response-5">Response #5</h4>
<p><em>In regards to your questions about your idea, my biggest question for you would be how similar this is to the feature within LinkedIn Recruiter that tells us who is actively open to hearing about new positions.<br>
The salary piece would be important as LI only tells you if a candidate is open to new opportunities, what positions, where they are looking in the US, and whether they are open to Contract/Contract to Hire/Permanent.<br>
The idea sounds good and I know our company looks at folks who are “Open to New Opportunities” and goes after those folks accordingly.</em></p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>I decided to #FailFast on this one. Not a good fit for me personally.</p>

<p>I also ran validation tests on  <a href="https://nugget.one/nugget/103">Nugget #103: DevOps specific project management tool</a>. Here is the real email I sent out to set up customer development interviews.</p>

Hi {{firstName}},<br>
I came across your profile on LinkedIn, and was impressed by your DevOps experience at {{company}}.<br>
I am an entrepreneur and software developer.<br>
I am investigating the idea of a building a project management/flow tool to help DevOps teams like yours.<br>
It’s clear that you know a lot about this space and that’s why I am reaching out!<br>
Would you have 15 minutes for a quick chat so I can pick your brains about how you go about your daily business?<br>
Many Thanks,<br>

<p><em>Yeah I am available for a call, let me know a couple times that work for you.</em></p>

<p>I decided to #FailFast on this one. After talking to various prospects, I could not find a little snowball in it.</p>
<h4 id="example-of-a-personalized-outreach-email">Example of a Personalized Outreach Email</h4>
<p>As an exercise I asked a Nugget member to send me a cold outreach email pretending I was his target. This was his first pass:</p>
<p><em>Hello Justin,<br>
I came across your blog (<a href="http://justinvincent.com">http://justinvincent.com</a>) and though I reach out since you have an extensive experience as a geek.<br>
My name is Henrique Barbosa and I’m building a Saas product for the Happiness manager industry.<br>
Anyway, I’ve noticed that happiness in the workplace has become a valid concern for both employees and managers alike. That’s why I’m building a product that will help monitoring and analysing the happiness levels in your organization.<br>
I would love to chat with you about what features you think would be great for a product like that.<br>
If you think that’s interesting please reply to this message!<br>
I can chat anytime today or tomorrow.<br>
Many thanks,<br>
Henry</em></p>
<p>The main issue is it seemed a little contrived and also not very conversational. It also does not give much of a reason to want to help Henry.</p>
<p>A key thing to remember is that most people actually want to help people! An outreach email should play to that.</p>
<p>Here is a re-worked version that I, personally, would find very hard to resist.</p>
<p>*Hey Justin,<br>
I read your blog “I Do Not Have an Age, I Have a Version Number.” Wow, I have never thought about age like that! Thank you for that new way of looking at things.<br>
Anyway, I see you are a CTO and manage a team of developers. With that in mind, I had a question for you.<br>
I am researching the idea of building a tool to help company owners and managers keep their staff more happy! If you had a few minutes to chat about it, I would love to get your feedback on this idea and also chat about possible features.<br>
I am free to chat at any of these times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tue 1st Nov: 10am-2pm</li>
<li>Wed 2nd Nov: 10am-2pm<br>
Can you fit a 30 min slot anywhere in there?<br>
If yes, please reply and I’ll send you a google invite.<br>
Many Thanks,<br>
Henry Smith (soon to be ceo of a happiness product!)*</li>
</ul>
<p>So really the key elements in my version are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show them they are not just a number. Research them. Compliment them.</li>
<li>Do not go very deep into the product. “I am researching the idea of building a tool to…” is all you need.</li>
<li>Do not come across like you will be selling in any way, because you’re not! You are simply looking for their help.</li>
<li>Give them some specific options for a time and tell them you will set up the Google invite.</li>
<li>Keep things light.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="should-i-send-from-my-personal-address-or-project-domain">Should I send from my personal address or project domain?</h4>
<p>When sending these types of emails I recommend you use your personal email address, because it feels less salesy and more along the lines of “help a brother out”.</p>
<p>Then, when you are interacting with people already on your mailing list, you can use your branded email address for those later conversations.</p>
