<h1 id="work-up-a-scratch-your-own-itch-idea">Work up a “scratch your own itch” idea</h1>
<p><em>If you have any questions about this action, ask us in Discord, we will answer there and add to an FAQ here.</em></p>
<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<ol>
<li>Think about problems you face in your day-to-day life. They could be recurring big issues (like the ongoing need for childcare) or little annoyances (like running out of coffee creamer).</li>
<li>Zero in on one or two problems that could potentially be solved, or at least eased, via a product someone could build.</li>
<li>Remember to apply the concepts from  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/stage/2/step/2">Step 2 - Learn how to be open when considering ideas</a>: think about the business domain, the market, the value chain, the “little snowball,” and think optimistically.</li>
<li>Get creative!</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Spend no more than 30-60 minutes generating at least one “scratch your own itch” idea, and jot the idea(s) down.</p>
<p>If you come up with several ideas, great! But be sure to generate at least one.</p>
<p>As always, the idea doesn’t need to be perfect at this point. We just want to add it to the list, and we’ll be coming back to it in a later action.</p>
