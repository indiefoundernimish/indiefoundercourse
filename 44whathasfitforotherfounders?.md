<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Different founder types with examples of businesses that could be a good fit for them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/snowflakes.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Product/founder fit is a bit of a nebulous concept, so I want to take the fuzziness out of it and show you some more concrete examples.</p>
<h4 id="when-thinking-about-productfounder-fit-we-typically-think-about-it-through-the-lens-of-facets-like-these">When thinking about product/founder fit, we typically think about it through the lens of facets like these:</h4>
<ul>
<li>What is your time Availability?</li>
<li>Are you married? (time = time-25%)</li>
<li>Do you have kids? (time = time-65%)</li>
<li>Are you introverted? (content/paid marketing?)</li>
<li>Are you outgoing? (guru marketing?)</li>
<li>Are you a developer? (integration marketing?)</li>
<li>Are you a growth hacker?</li>
<li>Do you have an MBA?</li>
<li>What are your monthly cash requirements?</li>
<li>What are your monthly revenue goals?</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone has slightly different facets that are important to them, but they often relate to one of these five buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Pricing</li>
<li>Product</li>
<li>Customers</li>
<li>Market</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="productfounder-fit-examples">Product/Founder Fit Examples</h2>
<p>I’ve created some quick examples of good product/founder fit below by incorporating some of these facets and matching them with products from Indie Hackers. Obviously, these founder profiles are highly simplified, but the matching products are real.</p>
<h4 id="introverted-solo-developer-10-20hweek">Introverted Solo Developer (10-20h/week)</h4>
<p>Perfect projects for these types are “useful software tools.” They can be built by a single developer. The version 1.0 can usually be released quickly. They can be marketed on the slow boil (content marketing, forum posting, etc.) and can gather steam over time. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="outgoing-solo-developer-10-20hweek">Outgoing Solo Developer (10-20h/week)</h4>
<p>These folks have the same options as the introvert, but can also consider guru-type training or useful subscription content. In some cases they don’t need to be overtly outgoing, but still, they need to be willing to put their ideas and opinions on the line.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="general-full-time-solo-developer-40hweek">General Full-Time Solo Developer (40+h/week)</h4>
<p>With 40-60 hours/week time availability, these folks have more options. They can tackle much larger problems. I don’t recommend taking this route for a first project. However, if you already have a lot of cash under your belt, then go for it! Just note that you may need to spend years on this, so you better make very sure that you love the hell out of it!</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h4 id="teams">Teams</h4>
<p>Teams can also tackle larger, more complicated projects. If you can create a team of people who you trust and who will actually do work, then you have some leverage. Here are some great projects built by teams:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/interview/using-low-cost-marketing-strategies-to-generate-26k-mo-302fb5f585">Snappa</a>  Graphic Design Tool ($26k/month)</li>

</ul>
<p><em>Optional Action</em></p>
<p>Spend some time exploring the products on Indie Hackers, and put yourself in the founder’s shoes. What products can you see yourself building, marketing, launching, and maintaining? On the flip side, what products would you definitely  <em>not</em>  want to work on? What similarities between those products are you noticing? What does this tell you about your product/founder fit?</p>
