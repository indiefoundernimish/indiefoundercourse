<ul>
<li>What one thing is the center of this onion?</li>
<li>What one thing will help the most customers… the most?</li>

</ul>
<p>Again, remember to use your best judgment and base your decisions on what you learned in validation. If you’re feeling stuck, reach out to Justin, Nimish or on Discord!</p>
