<h1 id="discover-ideas--markets">Discover Ideas &amp; Markets</h1>
<p>There are those that say “ideas” are not a very good place to start. Instead, we should start with a specific market (ie Carpenters) and ask them about their pain points and bootstrap a solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the “boring bootstrapper, harder than it sounds” way to start a side project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, the VC growth model wants us to pick a hot idea that can become a unicorn and get funding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the “exciting entreporn, snowball chance in hell” way to start a side project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem with both of these methods is they have no strategy related to the most important aspect of your startup:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>"YOU"</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="force-multipliers">Force Multipliers</h3>
<p>Specifically, there are a number of Force Multipliers that can exponentially increase your chance of success.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a product that matches your entrepreneurial growth stage</li>
<li>Pick a product you will like for years to come</li>
<li>Pick a market you have a way in to</li>
<li>Pick a product that suits your lifestyle</li>
<li>Pick a domain you know something about</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, our approach is to help you front load your project with as many unfair advantages as possible BEFORE you pick an idea (or market) to validate.</p>
<p>This is a game changer.</p>
<p>It sets you up for success from the get go.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-front-load-success">How to Front Load Success</h3>
<p>As you might imagine, it can be a bit difficult to snap your fingers and come up with an idea that suits you perfectly in every way, and is also a profitable idea in a great market… but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>We do this by taking inspiration from the book Art &amp; Fear by David Bayles &amp; Ted Orland:</p>
<p>Excerpt from Art &amp; Fear</p>
<p><em>A ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pounds of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect one - to get an “A”.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: <strong>the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.</strong>  It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work - and learning from their mistakes - the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.</em></p>
<p>In other words, we front load success by leveraging the power of Hyper Iteration. Our process is simple and repeatable:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate a lot of ideas [Stage 2]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Axe ideas without required business fundamentals [Stage 3]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Axe ideas without required force multipliers [Stage 4]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a top idea to validate [Stage 4]</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="stage-2-fast-and-furious">Stage 2: Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>Specifically, in Stage 2, we’ll explore how to be open to ideas, and then how to generate ideas using six methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse through Nugget’s ideas.</li>
<li>Find a community or niche to serve.</li>
<li>Clone and tweak success.</li>
<li>Scratch your own itch.</li>
<li>Look within yourself.</li>
<li>Run a Mechanical Turk HIT</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout this stage, we’ll use each of these idea-generating methods to create a long list of potential ideas.</p>
<p><strong><em>Don’t stress about finding the perfect idea at this point!</em></strong></p>
<p>In this stage you’re just building a list, the longer and more diverse, the better.</p>
<p>This is because you’ll want to start Stage 3 with a lot of options, and we’ll work from there to strategically narrow your choices before building an excellent  <em>Product/Founder Fit</em>  in Stage 4.</p>
<h3 id="were-aiming-for-50-ideas">We’re Aiming for 50+ Ideas</h3>
<p>I would like you to have as many ideas on your list as possible by the end of this Stage 2. We’re aiming for a minimum 50 ideas. If you can get even more, that’s great! In other words, be very liberal about what you put on your list.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about that big number. We have excellent methods for finding the top 3 candidate ideas coming up in Stages 3 &amp; 4. In fact, they work better if you start with a big list.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-about-markets">A Note About Markets</h3>
<p>We’ll touch on this in Lesson 3 and return to it in later stages:  <strong><em>sometimes the best way to find an idea is to immerse yourself in a certain market</em></strong>.</p>
<p>That’s why this stage is called “Discover Ideas &amp; Markets.”</p>
<p>So pay attention to the  <strong><em>markets</em></strong>  that keep coming up for you as you explore this stage. If you tend to gravitate to ideas focused around a certain group of people, that is a good indication that you should spend some time researching that group.</p>
