<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The value of mockups during the validation stage.</li>
<li>The difference between lo-fi and hi-fi mockups and when to use each.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-mockup-your-best-guess-solution">Why Mockup Your Best-Guess Solution?</h3>
<p>Well, in a nutshell, the reason is this…</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/stack-bottom.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Every time we make a guess instead of asking,  <strong><em>we are wasting our own time</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Sure, sure, there’s the famous quote by Henry Ford:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ignoring the fact  <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/28/ford-faster-horse/">Henry Ford never said that</a>, it is honestly terrible “wisdom.”</p>
<p>The very fact that we are making something for someone  <em>else</em>  means  <em>they</em>  should be included in core decisions about how it works and what it does.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how ridiculous this would be in other professions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wedding planner who never speaks to the people getting married. They just make a best guess about what they might want.</li>
<li>A house painter who never speaks to the house owner. They just take a best guess about which rooms to paint and what colors to use.</li>
<li>A designer who never speaks to clients. They just take a best guess about what the client might want.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds crazy, right?</p>
<p>But this is exactly what tens of thousands of founders do every day in the world of tech startups!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-mockup">What is a Mockup?</h3>
<p>This question is not as dumb as it sounds.</p>
<p>As we move from validation to reality, we want to be sure that we progressively move each aspect of our idea from low resolution to high resolution.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/pixilate.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This concept is just as true for our brand as it is for the words we say, our UI, homepage marketing, etc.</p>
<p>When looked at in this light,  <em>everything</em>  can be mocked up and shared with customers  <em>before</em>  we start putting in too much effort. This enables us to get a gut check before we start doing the hard work of adding detail.</p>
<p>This is  <em>especially</em>  easy to do with Super Seeds in our Slack focus group.</p>
<p>So, let’s say we’re building a course or writing a book. In this case, our first “low-resolution mockup” is the outline of the course.</p>
<p>In other words, a bullet point list.</p>
<p>Imagine how easy it would be to simply share a bullet point list with a group of Super Seeds on Slack and ask them for a sanity check.</p>
<p><em>“<em>Hey, guys I’ve come up with a 10-chapter outline for my new book about XYZ. Can you have a quick look and let me know if I’ve missed anything or if there is anything else you want me to cover?</em>”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Chapter 1: Introduction to XYZ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chapter 2: How to get a high paying job with XYZ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re talking about validating  <em>entire chapters</em>  at this point, but all we’ve done is written a bullet point list!</p>
<p>We’re speaking to our actual customers, who are helping us validate that we’re starting out in the right place.</p>
<p>Now, let’s consider the alternative.</p>
<p>We guess what chapters to write. We spend 12 months writing our book. We release it on Amazon, and it’s only in Amazon reviews that we discover we wasted 3 months on unnecessary content and missed out on important content.</p>
<p>What Can We Mockup and Share with Super Seeds?</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature Ideas</li>
<li>New UI/UX Ideas</li>
<li>Content ideas</li>
<li>Branding Ideas</li>
<li>Marketing Ideas</li>
<li>New Process Ideas</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Super Seeds  <em>love</em>  to be involved in all that stuff. The key point to remember is Super Seeds are already deep into the niche. They already know lots of other target customers in the niche and have a pretty good idea about  <em>their</em>  wants and needs too.</p>
<p>Also, Super Seeds will most likely be deeply invested in your success and will want to live vicariously through what you’re doing as you build out your product.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-mockup-your-best-guess-solution">How to Mockup Your Best-Guess Solution</h3>
<p>There are  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+create+an+app+mockup">lots of tutorials</a>  that explain how to create mockups. So I don’t think I need to get into that level of detail here. For this lesson, I am just going to explain my core process.</p>
<ol>
<li>I use  <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq mockups</a>  for Low-fi mockups (it has a quirky sketch look that seems freindly to show to seeds). That said, feel free to use  <a href="https://moqups.com/">Moqups</a>  if you don’t want to use additional mockups software.</li>
<li>When I plan things out, I never mockup more than one core functional idea per page (so that I can share one idea with customers at a time).</li>
<li>I try to  <em>use as few components as possible</em>  to answer the “is this useful” question. For example, in the first Pluggio Low-fi mockup (below), I just wanted to find out if people liked the idea of a side nav bar to switch between Twitter accounts.</li>
<li>As soon as my mockup expresses the core functional idea I want, I show it to Super Seeds to see what they think and then iterate based on feedback.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll take a close look at how to mock up your full product in Stage 8. For now, we’ll focus on lo-fi mockups, which you can think of as less of a design and more of a visual communication of what your product might do.</p>
<h3 id="low-fi-mockups-vs-hi-fi-mockups">Low-fi Mockups vs Hi-fi Mockups</h3>
<p>During the early validation stages  <em>Vapor</em>  &amp;  <em>Liquid</em>  I recommend we use Low-Fi mockups (see below for examples). There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<p><strong>Why Lo-fi?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We want to be able to iterate mockups as quickly as possible. The more detail we add up front, the more time it takes to change them.</li>
<li>We do not want customers to be put off by our style/color choices. We simply want to show how we will solve their problem.</li>
<li>Most mockup tools have templates for standard UI components like buttons, scrollbars, checkbox lists, etc. Relying on some of these templates for lo-fi mockups allows you to quickly pull a product idea together without getting too hung up on the details.</li>
</ul>
<p>After we start to get real clarity from our Super Seeds,] and are ready to move to a  <em>Solid</em>  landing page, we can move to Hi-fi mockups.</p>
<p><strong>Why Hi-fi?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hi-fi mockups are much better at convincing people to spend money and/or believe in our product.</li>
<li>They help us fully think through the design before we start building anything.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-low-fi-product-mockups">Example Low-fi Product Mockups</h3>
<p>This is one of the first mockups I created for Pluggio. I shared it with my Super Seeds, who really liked the side menu as a way to navigate multiple accounts. This was a different approach to TweetDeck, which was the best competing app at the time. My approach allowed a user to have multiple accounts but only focus on one at a time vs. the madness of TweetDeck’s multiple columns.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/pluggio-mockup-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After I launched Pluggio, I continued to work with my Super Seeds, who then started asking for more advanced automation functionality.</p>
<p>This is an early mockup of a way to plug in an RSS feed to Pluggio and then auto tweet newly added content. All of the features were requested by Super Seeds. Imagine if I had just guessed what to build and not iterated mockups with them!</p>

<h3 id="example-hi-fi-product-mockups">Example Hi-fi Product Mockups</h3>
<p>When I was validating the speech-to-text idea,  <a href="https://betalist.com/startups/spoke">Spoke</a>, I posted it to Betalist. For  <em>that</em>  community, I wanted to give them a sense of what the hands-on product would feel like. That’s why I created a  <em>Solid</em>  landing page with hi-fi mockups.</p>
<p>Here is a mockup of the main interface that would enable users to quickly make use of auto-transcribed meeting notes.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/spoke-mockup-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is a mockup of how easy it would be to search through auto-transcribed meetings.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/spoke-mockup-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Having a product that feels “real” with Hi-fi mockups can make a big difference to email signup conversions on sites like Betalist.</p>
<h3 id="example-brand-mockup">Example Brand Mockup</h3>
<p>Back when I launched the first version of Nugget, I worked with my Super Seeds to try to get them to pick great ideas and be successful. When no success happened, I realized that great ideas were not enough.</p>
<p>If I wanted to solve the problem of helping founders start profitable side projects, Nugget was going to need to be a  <em>lot</em>  more than ideas. It started to become clear that Nugget would need to evolve into something like the platform you see today.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I started to think along those lines, I was worried about the brand “Nugget.” Could it ever be taken seriously enough for a platform like this?</p>
<p>Rather than sit on the wrong brand for two years, I wanted to see if I needed to change it. With that in mind, I asked customers about it and showed them a mockup of another more serious brand.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/brand-research.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>The overwhelming response from paying customers was that we should “stick with Nugget.”</p>
<h3 id="info-product-mockups">Info Product Mockups</h3>
<p><strong>Lofi Mockups</strong></p>
<p>A high level outline of your course (basically just chapter titles).</p>
<p><strong>Hifi Mockups</strong></p>
<p>Hifi mockups are a detailed outline including section titles within the chapters.</p>
<p>Send them your seeds and gather feedback on the proposed content. Also, feel free to send initial drafts of your content to seeds.</p>
<h3 id="important">Important</h3>
<ul>
<li>No matter what thing you are mocking up, keep it simple and stick to the center of the onion in question. For example, there is no point in mocking up login and registration pages unless they are somehow part of your core value proposition.</li>
<li>When sharing mockups with your Super Seeds, try to share only one concept at a time. It’s difficult for people to give good feedback when their focus is split between multiple ideas.</li>
<li>Share and iterate your mockups with your Super Seeds and your batch  <em>often</em>.</li>
</ul>
