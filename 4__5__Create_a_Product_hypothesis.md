<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a lean canvas</li>
<li>How to use that lean canvas to generate a product hypothesis</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s say you were drilling for oil. You didn’t know exactly “where” it was. But you knew it was in a specific quadrant of land. You had picked 3 possible starting points to investigate.</p>
<p>Unknown to you, one of those starting points was directly on top of the oil. The other two were not on top, but with work and some sideways drilling, you would be able to get there.</p>
<p>With the starting point directly on top of the oil, it would take two days to discover the oil. With the other two starting points, it would take anywhere from four to twelve weeks to discover the oil.</p>
<p><em>Question</em></p>
<p>So, would your optimal strategy be to pick one random starting point and keep working it?</p>
<p>Or, would your optimal strategy be to investigate all three starting points and spend a day or two on each?</p>
<p><em>Answer</em></p>
<p>By picking more than one starting point, you increase your luck surface area and give yourself better odds.</p>

<h2 id="lean-canvas">Lean Canvas</h2>
<p>A lean canvas is an excellent way to investigate each starting point. It makes it easy to lay out your thoughts and identify your riskiest assumption and market potential in less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>This will help you get a better handle on which is your top idea.</p>
<p>In your next action, you’ll be creating a lean canvas for each of your top three ideas, rather than just focusing on one.</p>
<p>Lean Canvas Explained</p>
<hr>
<p>First, check out the structure of a lean canvas as explained by  <a href="https://leanstack.com/LeanCanvas.pdf">LeanStack</a>, and we’ll explore each component below. We’ll be jumping around a bit, so use the image as a guide for the remainder of this lesson.</p>
<p>And note, there are other methods to filling out a lean canvas, but we’ll be using the customer-centric approach, starting with people and solving the problem they have.</p>
<p>After all, that’s what Nugget is all about!</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/lean-canvas-numbered.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Section #1: Problem &amp; Customer Segments</p>
<hr>
<p>Look on the upper-right and left sides of the canvas. These are the two segments that should drive the remaining sections.</p>
<p>You’ll start with the customer segment and list out the most likely customers for your product idea. No need to get into too much detail. Simply listing “Web Developers” or “Parents” will work for now.</p>
<p>After you’ve filled out your customer segments, you’ll list out one or more problems that you think each customer segment has. Keep these simple as well. “Content marketing is time-consuming” could be a great example of a problem here.</p>
<p>Section #2: Unique Value Proposition</p>
<hr>
<p>This section distills everything you’re trying to do down into a simple statement.</p>
<p>A perfect UVP quickly sums up what your product is, who it’s for, how it’s different, and why it’s worth paying for. Often times, the UVP serves as the product tagline or the banner at the top of the website landing page.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about getting it 100% right now. Just put down a best guess and iterate as you keep working up the idea. An example UVP for an on-demand delivery service might be something like “The easiest way to get fast food in less than 20 minutes.”</p>
<p>Section #3: Solution</p>
<hr>
<p>Your solution will also iterate many times as you start speaking to customers. So, again, don’t get obsessed. Use your best guess for now and iterate as needed.</p>
<p>The important part here is to look at the problems you listed just to the left, and use those to tightly align your solutions. A quick list of the solutions to your customer problems should add a little detail and clarity on top of your UVP.</p>
<p>Section #4: Channels</p>
<hr>
<p>Channels are the way to customers. One of the most important pieces of information you’ll want to gather during customer interviews and validation is to understand where your customers hang out. You may not be an expert yet, but at this step, you’ll want to list your best ideas about how you might find and acquire customers.</p>
<p>Example channels could include standing on the street and handing out cards, focusing on email outreach, forming partnerships, using web advertising models like PPC, etc.</p>
<p>Again, you’ll learn more about the best channels for your particular customers during validation, when you’re actually talking to those customers, but you may already have a few ideas to get started, so you’ll jot them down here.</p>
<p>Section #5: Revenue Streams &amp; Cost Structure</p>
<hr>
<p>As you saw in the lesson “Learn why goals &amp; price points matter,” this section can make or break your pursuit of an idea. Look back at the price points that can get you to your revenue goal (reminder, you worked through these when making your product/founder fit facets) and see if any of those price points could fit this idea.</p>
<p>In the Cost Structure area, be sure to include the ongoing costs you’ll be incurring to build this solution. Will there be considerable web hosting fees? Are you planning to pay someone to help you with marketing or building? For most bootstrapped side projects, these ongoing costs are low, but be sure to take a minute to think them through, and consider if those costs might drive a change in your pricing.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is your hypothesis. Soon you will need to validate it and discover if this canvas can hold up the price points you specify. Can the market bear those prices? Are there enough customers? Can you acquire them? etc.</p>
<p>Section #6: Key Metrics</p>
<hr>
<p>Keep this simple. What do you think are key metrics for acquisition/lead generation and retention/churn? In other words, what are the key activities that people will use your product to complete?</p>
<p>For a job board platform, for instance, the key metrics would be searching and applying for jobs.</p>
<p>Section #7: Unfair Advantage</p>
<hr>
<p>Save this section for last because it can be difficult to get right. There is a good chance you don’t have an unfair advantage right now as there are really only 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>You have an extensive and knowledgeable network in the space</li>
<li>You have an extensive prebuilt audience that knows you and your capabilities well</li>
<li>You have deep growth expertise in this space</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of those apply to you, don’t stress. Leave this area blank if it’s not a natural fit.</p>

<p>Continuing with the GetHappy example, here is a lean canvas worked up for that idea:</p>

<p>Here is an example Lean Canvas for  <a href="https://nugget.one/nugget/332">Nugget #332: Rock solid backup tool for massive media projects</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Idea</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Create backup software for the creative audio and visual industry</li>

<p>As you can imagine, having three of these side-by-side will help you thoughtfully and effectively rank your top three ideas. You may not have struck oil yet, but you’ll be one step closer.</p>
