<ul>
<li>Create your landing page with your starter brand.</li>
<li>Pick a domain (see notes).</li>
<li>Register your domain (see notes).</li>
<li>Plug the domain into your landing page (see notes).</li>
<li>Note your new landing page URL in the Action Response box at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Time to take action! Go for it - write your headline, add a subheading, be sure to include your starter brand, and play with your colors and fonts as needed.</p>
<p>The final two lessons and actions of this stage walk you through plugging in website analytics and a mailing list signup. It’s a good idea to look ahead at those now, and consider tackling the remainder of this stage as one big action here!</p>
<p><em>Notes about Picking a Domain</em></p>
<p>In  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/stage/5/step/2">Learn how to create a starter brand - Part 1</a>, we discussed two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Method #1: Tweak a .com</strong></li>
<li><strong>Method #2: Use an Alternative TLD</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Please review that material if you haven’t already picked your domain name.</p>
<p><em>Notes about Registering a Domain</em></p>
<p>If you don’t already have a regular registrar, you can easily register your domain at either of these sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://godaddy.com/">Go Daddy</a>  - Easiest platform to manage multiple domains. Very cheap for major TLD’s like .com, .co, .net, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Name Cheap</a>  - More technical but cheaper for some TLD’s like .io</li>
</ul>
<p>Note</p>
<p>I’ve found GoDaddy to be the easiest option because not only is their platform easy to use, other services (like landing page providers) always have GoDaddy-specific integration instructions.</p>
<p><em>Notes about Plugging Your Domain In</em></p>
<p>Each landing page service has specific instructions within their help documentation that explains how to plug your custom domain into their system.</p>
<p>Remember that you can use Discord if you’re looking for initial feedback or help. And don’t get down on yourself if this isn’t the most impressive site in the world - it shouldn’t be! Remember to keep it simple, and avoid the itch to build a full site for now. That opportunity will come down the road!</p>
<p>You got this!</p>
