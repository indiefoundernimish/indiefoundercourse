<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>Use what you have learned in the last lesson to create a Lean Canvas for each of your top three ideas.</p>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Before you get started, there are a few things to de-stress about:</p>
<ul>
<li>This doesn’t need to consume your whole day. There’s no need to spend more than 20-40 minutes per lean canvas.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to leave some sections blank. It’s likely that you won’t be an expert on each of your product ideas at this point, and that’s ok.</li>
<li>Be as concise as possible. No need to get too in the weeds right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, go for it! Create a lean canvas for each of your top three ideas. There are plenty of online options, or you can go old school and work with paper/pencil. Your call!

<p>Remember to use the customer-driven approach, filling out the canvas in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customers &amp; Problem</li>
<li>Unique Value Proposition</li>
<li>Solution</li>
<li>Channels</li>
<li>Cost Structure &amp; Revenue Streams</li>
<li>Key Metrics</li>
</ol>
<p>Look back at the last lesson for help and examples. Once you’ve got your three complete canvases, you’ll be ready to discuss them with your cohort and pick your top idea to bring with you into Stage 5!</p>
