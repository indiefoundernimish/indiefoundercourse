<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>How to take your customer learnings and imagine your product’s full potential.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-think-big">Why Think Big?</h3>
<p>I want you to think big before you think small. This is mainly so you can exorcise your demons and get the  <em>thinking big</em>  out of your system. This, in turn, will enable you to double down on your little snowball.</p>
<p>Plus, there are some additional reasons to map out your product’s (or book’s or course’s) full potential at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>To collect customer learnings into a single document</li>
<li>To gain an understanding about your product’s future potential</li>
<li>To get everything out of your head and get it organized</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, when you prune it back (next lesson), you can be extra sure you are focusing on the right little snowball and not wasting any effort.</p>
<h3 id="what-method-should-we-use">What Method Should We Use?</h3>
<p>The very best way I’ve found to do this is by using a Mind Map. Mind Mapping allows us to quickly gather and organize our ideas in a highly visual way that just makes sense.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a full-potential Mind Map I created for the Happy idea, growing it from a Lean Canvas:</p>
<p>Happy Example</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/get-happy-full.pdf">Happy - Full Potential Mind Map</a></li>
<li><a href="https://canvanizer.com/canvas/r6tN7qmyoREb9">Happy - Lean Canvas</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note, when you start this process,  <strong><em>your Mind Map will probably be bigger than the Happy example.</em></strong>  I left a lot of detail out to make it easier to read. Here is a fuller example of what I would expect your final full potential Mind Map to look like:</p>
<p>CrewStation Example</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/mindmap-crewstation.pdf">CrewStation - Full Potential Mind Map</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nugget.one/nugget/500">Nugget #500: CrewStation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Mind Mapping is not just for software products; it is also perfect for courses and books. For example, myself and Laura Mind Mapped the Nugget Startup Academy course.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/nugget-course.pdf">Nugget Academy Course - Mind Map</a></p>
<p>Mind Mapping also works well for planning in general. For example, Laura and I created this Mind Map to fully spec out the work we needed to do for Nugget version 3.0. In this case, the course  <em>and</em>  the platform are in the Mind Map.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/nugget-complete.pdf">Nugget 3.0 - Mind Map</a></p>
<p>As you can see, the Nugget Mind Maps are large. However, it is easy to work with them in a Mind Map editor. Mind Maps allow you to quickly collapse and expand full nodes, which makes them perfect to work with these types of sprawling information structures.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-map-out-your-products-full-potential">How to Map out Your Product’s Full Potential</h3>
<p>This is the exact process I use:</p>
<p><strong>Step #1</strong></p>
<p>Synthesize all of your customer validation feedback and break it down into common functional themes.</p>
<p>For example, in the Happy Mind Map, the top-level functional themes are things like the  <em>Employee Handbook Creator</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-06-14-134426.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Add each of those top-level themes to your Mind Map.</p>
<p>Note, I’ve also listed some other top-level concepts like  <em>User Types</em>. I’ll add anything that helps me get a full picture of this idea in a single brain dump snapshot.</p>
<p><strong>Step #2</strong></p>
<p>For each top-level item, break it down into functional components. This will help further explain it. For example, I added the following sub nodes to the  <em>Employee Handbook Creator</em>  node:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-06-14-111826.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Step #3</strong></p>
<p>If you want, you can take can this one step further and add another sub level. For example, I added more detail to the  <em>Employee Handbook</em>,  <em>How the Office Works</em>  node:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-06-14-112833.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Step #4</strong></p>
<p>After you’ve finished Mind Mapping your customer validation feedback, take a moment to zoom back out and consider if there are other interesting directions you might be able to take the product one day.</p>
<p>For example, perhaps one day Happy might plug into Payroll systems and use that data to help drive staff satisfaction.</p>

<p><strong>Step #5</strong></p>
<p>Stop!</p>
<p>This is harder than it sounds. Once you get going on this, it can be a lot of fun. Try not to include anything  <em>too</em>  far outside the core scope of your idea, but get your thinking down, and prepare to move on!</p>
<h3 id="mind-mapping-tools">Mind Mapping Tools</h3>
<p>Here are some popular Mind Mapping tools.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download">FreeMind</a>  - OSX, Windows, Linux. Open source &amp; free. Works perfectly well for what we need here.</li>
<li><a href="https://mindnode.com/">MindNode</a>  - OSX. My favorite mind mapping software by far. ($40)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mindjet.com/">MindJet</a>  - OSX. Windows. Works well. A free trial is available. ($179-$349)</li>
</ul>
<p>As an aside, this is a perfect example of how most markets have a range of products from free to premium. Free offerings do not stop you from being able to create a paid offering. The trick is to make your paid offering  <em>good</em>.</p>
