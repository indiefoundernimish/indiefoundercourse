<ul>
<li>Select a Mind Map tool and start by putting your brand name in the center of the map.</li>
<li>Add your top-level functional themes based on validation feedback.</li>
<li>Break each top-level item down into functional components.</li>
<li>Add sub-levels to the components where needed. Get detailed!</li>
<li>Add future potential areas of growth, but don’t get bogged down with details in these areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>Having trouble identifying your top-level items, or distinguishing them from the functional components? Don’t worry about getting the exact “right” structure.</p>
<p>Different people could Mind Map the same product in different ways. Just try to identify and organize all the possible components. Move things around, step away and come back later, do what you need to do to get it out of your head!</p>
<p>Looking back at and revising your original Lean Canvas from Stage 4 might be helpful, but don’t let that skew your idea of what’s important. Be sure the core of your Mind Map is based on your experiences and conversations with your seed group!</p>
