<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>
<p>To complete our Super Seed Factory, we want  <strong><em>all</em></strong>  people who join our email list to get an invite to our Slack Focus Group.</p>
<p>To do this we’ll need to add an automated welcome email that is sent when someone joins.</p>
<p>Our welcome email should look something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Subject: Slack Invite</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Important Note About Language</em></strong></p>
<p>The language here is quite intentional. I’m specifically calling it a focus group because I want to appeal to Super Seeds. Remember, they are the ones who love the niche and want to live vicariously through us as we build out our product. They will see the work as a public service and want to help us out.</p>
<p>This is a very different value proposition to presenting ourselves as the de facto expert. Even if we are creating an info product, it’s optimal for us to ask people to sign up to our focus group to help us design a better info product that serves them better.</p>
<p><strong><em>If we ask for help, we’ll attract helpful people.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>How to Create the Slack Invite Link</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Important Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using cold outreach only (i.e. have no mailing list), still make a point of inviting each person to your Slack group.</li>
<li>Assuming you connected and had some kind of positive interaction, it’s the perfect way to keep in touch if they become a Super Seed.</li>
</ul>
