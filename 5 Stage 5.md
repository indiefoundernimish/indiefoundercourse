<h3 id="yes-or-no">Yes or No</h3>
<p>Stage 5-7 are where the real magic happens. We’ll be taking the work you’ve done so far and turning it into a solid yes or… no.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you picked an idea to validate, you’ll be able to say  <strong><em>yes or no</em></strong>  about moving forward with it.</li>
<li>If you picked a market to explore, you’ll be able to say  <strong><em>yes or no</em></strong>  about that market.</li>
<li>If the answer is  <strong><em>no</em></strong>, then we’ll loop back here with your next idea (or market) and go through Stage 5-7 again.</li>
<li><strong><em>We will not stop until we get a  YES!</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-do-we-get-to-a-yes-or-no">How Do We Get to a Yes or No?</h3>
<p>To effectively get to our yes or no, we’ll need three components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A calling card</li>
<li>A seed group</li>
<li>A way to find out what they want</li>
</ol>
<p>Which is another way of saying:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage 5:</strong>  Build Bare Bones Landing Page</li>
<li><strong>Stage 6:</strong>  Pick a Seed Group Strategy</li>
<li><strong>Stage 7:</strong>  Listen &amp; Learn</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>We will be working in the bottom two layers of the stack during stages 5-7. Remember, this is the reverse of focusing on yourself and your product first. Focusing instead on the bottom of the stack might push you out of your comfort zone, but it will save you time and effort in the long run!</p>

<h3 id="why-a-landing-page">Why a Landing Page?</h3>
<p>A landing page is somewhere useful to direct people to during early discussions and outreach. Think of it like a calling card with benefits.</p>
<p>Without some kind of landing page, you have nowhere to hang your hat during those first discussions.</p>
<p>Your landing page is also the place where you capture the email addresses of your seed group.</p>
<p>A nice side benefit of a landing page is that it starts you thinking about what your brand might be. A brand is not 100% necessary during this early validation phase, but it’s good practice for the real deal and it’s  <em>fun</em>, which can take the edge off the work.</p>
