<li>How to structure your sales site to make it sticky and convert customers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>This lesson contains  <em>a lot</em>  of recommended reading. We’ve done our best to synthesize the key points for you, but we encourage you to read as much as you can on this important topic, and refer back to this lesson as needed throughout the remainder of the Academy stages, and beyond!</p>

<h3 id="sales-site-theory">Sales Site Theory</h3>
<p>Take a look at the above spider web. It’s the perfect mental model for our sales site. We want to create a large and highly relevant surface area. We want lots of places a user can land on our site.</p>
<p>Each of those places should function like the arrow Philippe Petit fired from the World Trade Center roof. An initial wire for a customer to pick up.</p>
<p>Each touchpoint, each part of our website, is a chance for us to use Man on Wire theory to build trust and persuasion and bring our customer from the outside to the inside.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we should take  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/stage/1/step/5">Recursive Quality Factor</a>  into consideration, because we never know exactly where a user will land on our site.</p>
<h4 id="caveats-about-this-lesson">Caveats about this Lesson</h4>
<ul>
<li>This lesson focuses on our sales site (not the entire sales machine).</li>
<li>This lesson focuses on site structure, not sales copy, which will be covered in a later lesson.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sales-site-structure">Sales Site Structure</h3>
<p>This is an excellent sales site structure for most product types:</p>
<p><strong><em>Sales Related</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page #1: Home Page</strong></li>
<li><strong>Page #2: Plans &amp; Pricing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Page #3: Case Studies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Page #4: FAQ</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Company Related</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Page #5: About</strong></li>
<li><strong>Page #6: Terms &amp; Privacy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Page #7: Contact</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I will expand on each page below as they all have their own nuances.</p>
<p><em>A Note About Product Types</em></p>
<p>The above sales site structure is excellent for any of these product types:</p>
<ul>
<li>SaaS App</li>
<li>Info Product</li>
<li>Productized Service</li>
<li>Membership Site</li>
<li>WordPress Plugin</li>
<li>Platform Plugin</li>
<li>Desktop App</li>
<li>Mobile App</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="page-1-home-page">Page #1: Home Page</h3>
<p>The function of our home page is to download our product’s benefits and features into our visitor’s brain as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The best way to achieve that is to tell them, tell them again, then tell them again, tell them one more time, and finally tell them again, each time with slightly more detail.</p>
<p>The Nuance of Telling Them Five Times</p>
<p>It’s ye old “Center of The Onion” mental model again. Each time we tell them, we are trying to impart our product benefits and features. Starting with the center of the onion and adding more detail as they go deeper into our home page.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first time we tell them with our brand name and logo.</li>
<li>The second time we tell them with our headline.</li>
<li>The third time we tell them with our subheading.</li>
<li>The fourth time we tell them with our feature bullet points.</li>
<li>The fifth time we tell them with our detail panels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Home Page Structure</p>
<p>These are the core components of a great home page. I explain each item in a more detail below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand</li>
<li>Headline</li>
<li>Subheading</li>
<li>Call to Action</li>
<li>Feature Bullet Points</li>
<li>Feature Detail Panels</li>
<li>Social Proof</li>
<li>Video Demo (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>While the structure outlined here makes a great starter homepage for any product, this is just a starting point. As your business evolves, so will your homepage.</p>
<p><strong>Brand</strong></p>
<p>Our brand is the center of the onion. It should give a catchy hint about what our product is and also what the benefits might be. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-24-121622.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Headline</strong></p>
<p>A one-sentence selling point that sums up the core benefit and feature of the entire product. Front and center. Above the fold. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-24-093818.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Subheading</strong></p>
<p>One paragraph to further define the entire product and show more detail about the benefits. Front and center (smaller than headline). Above the fold. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-24-094051.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Call to Action</strong></p>
<p>A big button, or buttons. The main conversion for the home page. Usually something like “Join,” “Sign Up,” or “Start Trial.” Front and center. Above the fold. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-24-094134.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Feature Bullet Points (20,000ft View)</strong></p>
<p>It helps the user quickly grasp our product concept if we use micro-copy to break down our product into feature bullet points. Each bullet point, a 20,000ft view of the feature. Always highlight benefits. Front and center. Above the fold (if possible). Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-24-095312.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Feature Detail Panels</strong></p>
<p>Detail panels should be below the fold and listed in the same order as the feature bullet points. Wherever possible, include screenshots of the product framed in  <a href="https://facebook.design/devices">beautiful devices</a>. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-24-095727.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>Some sites have separate feature pages. Since our product is a little snowball, we don’t need that at this point.</p>
<p>Also, note there’s no one perfect way to structure these panels. Play with options here. A common format is to alternate between screenshots on the left and text on the right, then vice versa, but you may find your screenshots shine when they have more width across the full screen, with accompanying text above or below.</p>
<p><strong>Social Proof</strong></p>
<p>To build trust, always add some kind of testimonial section to the home page. This is where all that hard work building your  <em>Super Seed</em>  group pays off! Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-24-102133.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Another excellent way to provide social proof is to show logos of your customers. Here is an example taken from a Nugget member’s (@jjn’s) sales page for Press Advantage.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/screenshot-2018-07-26-124930.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>If you use logos, make sure to also have real people’s testimonial on the page as well as the logos.</p>
<p><strong>Video Demo</strong>  (Optional)</p>
<p>A short 30-60 second video can help build trust and sell the benefits of our product. If we include a video, we will want to make sure the play button is front and center and above the fold. Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/dropbox.jpg" alt=""></p>
