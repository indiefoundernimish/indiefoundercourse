<h3 id="method">Method</h3>
<p>Apply the little snowball concept to your list and axe ideas that are too complex.</p>
<p><em>Hints</em></p>
<p>It’s time to take another look at your list, and identify the ideas that are or can be reduced to a little snowball.</p>
<p>Remember, the typical indicators of a little snowball are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very simple idea with a single facet</li>
<li>Extremely low product surface area (frontend and backend)</li>
<li>Can generally be prototyped and brought to market in months</li>
<li>Likely to be instantly useful and quickly gain early-adopter traction (i.e., it’s something people want)</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there some potential snowballs on your list? Great!</p>
<p>Are you not sure about some? Well, that’s to be expected. How do you know if it’s something people want without talking to those people? If you’re not sure, leave it on the list for now.</p>
<p>But, if you know the idea is multifaceted, sprawling, and/or a long-term build that could require a full dev team and external investments/funding, cross it off!</p>
<p>If some ideas are not snowballs, they might still be interesting ideas, but they’re less likely to serve as a profitable side project. Let’s keep our eye on the prize!</p>
