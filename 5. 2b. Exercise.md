<h3 id="show--tell">Show &amp; Tell</h3>
<p>It’s time to share your brand! In Discord, share the image of your brand name with logo in your chosen font and color(s), and share around the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How/why did you decide on your brand?</li>
<li>How do you think it will appeal to your market?</li>
<li>What feedback do you have for the other brands shared here?</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of the brands here as a portfolio of potential. Some might make it all the way to Stage 12! Others will get a makeover along the way. And others will be scrapped entirely.</p>
<p>For now, just make sure you’re happy with your starter brand before you move on to building your landing page.</p>
