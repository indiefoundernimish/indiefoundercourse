<h4 id="twitter-strategy">Twitter Strategy</h4>
<p>Twitter can be one of the easiest and most effective sources with which to build your Seed Group. I used the below method to get many thousands of people to Pluggio’s homepage.</p>
<p><strong>Step #1:</strong>  Set up a compelling bio with a link to your landing page</p>
<p><strong>Step #2:</strong>  Define ua “Thanks for following” message with a link to your landing page</p>
<p><strong>Step #3:</strong>  Search for Seed Group candidates</p>
<p><strong>Step #4:</strong>  Follow them, compliment them, or both</p>
<p><strong>Step #5:</strong>  Repeat steps 3 &amp; 4 once per day (for 5-10 minutes)</p>
<p>Steps 1-4 have some nuance associated. See below for more detail.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-set-up-a-compelling-bio-with-a-link-to-your-landing-page">Step #1: Set Up a Compelling Bio with a Link to Your Landing Page</h4>
<p>If we interact with Twitter users in our target niche, some of them will check out our bio. To capitalize on this, we need to say something compelling in our bio and add a link to our landing page.</p>
<p>There are two core personas we can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Personal Persona</li>
<li>A Business Persona</li>
</ul>
<p>See below for detail.</p>
<h4 id="using-a-personal-persona">Using a Personal Persona</h4>
<p>If we use a personal persona, our goal is to get the viewer to like us on a personal level. We want them to want to support us by looking at what we’re doing.</p>
<p>Example Personal Persona Bio</p>
<p>I’m working nights &amp; weekends building <a href="http://GetHappy.io">GetHappy.io</a>. It’s an app for HR teams to gamify the workplace! Check it out and send me your feedback :)</p>
<p>In this case, this assumes we’re generally interacting with the HR niche users we searched for. Here’s what the interaction looks like end to end.</p>
<p>End to End Example</p>
<ol>
<li>We search for HR-related users</li>
<li>We follow a user from the search results</li>
<li>A few days later they say something funny</li>
<li>We react by saying something like “That just cracked me up”</li>
<li>They look at our bio</li>
<li>They click our landing page link</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="using-a-business-persona">Using a Business Persona</h4>
<p>If we use a business persona, our goal is to nail the value proposition. So, essentially, our bio becomes a mini landing page to get people to the real landing page.</p>
<p>Example Business Persona Bio</p>
<p>We make life easier for HR teams. Use our platform to add gamification to your workforce, and staff retention will go through the roof!</p>
<p><a href="https://GetHappy.io">https://GetHappy.io</a></p>
<p>Again, this assumes we’re interacting with HR-niche users we searched for. Here’s what the interaction looks like end to end.</p>
<p>End to End Example</p>
<ol>
<li>We search for HR related users</li>
<li>We follow a user from the search results</li>
<li>A few days later they say something about the HR industry</li>
<li>We react by saying something like “Great stats you posted - what was your source?”</li>
<li>They look at our bio</li>
<li>They click our landing page link</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="step-2-define-a-thanks-for-following-message">Step #2: Define a “Thanks for following” Message</h4>
<p>There are two things to think about here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a compelling message</li>
<li>Send new followers your thanks for following message via Direct Message</li>
</ol>
<p>See below for detail.</p>
<h4 id="crafting-a-thanks-for-following-message">Crafting a “Thanks for following” Message</h4>
<p>We need this to be short and to the point. It’s ok to mention our product as long as we do it in a non-spammy way. Again, we want our thank you message to be tightly targeted to the niche we’re working.</p>
<p><em>Example Message</em></p>
<pre><code>Thanks so much for following! I'm building https://GetHappy.io. for HR teams to gamify the work place. If you had time, I would love to hear your thoughts!
</code></pre>
<p>That last sentence is optional. I would just try something like that out in your niche to see if it increases clicks and replies.</p>
<p>End to End Example</p>
<ol>
<li>We search for HR-related users</li>
<li>We follow a user from the search results</li>
<li>They get an auto “Thanks for following”</li>
<li>They read it</li>
<li>They click our landing page link</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="sending-your-thanks-for-following-message">Sending your “Thanks For Following” Message</h4>
<p>There is no way to setup an automated “thanks for following message” because Twitter will not allow it. So you will need to keep looking at your list of followers on Twitter and when you get new followers manually send them your message.</p>
<p>This should just be part of your daily 5-10 minute workflow when you login to Twitter.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-search-for-seed-group-candidates">Step #3: Search for Seed Group Candidates</h4>
<p>The trick here is to  <strong><em>search current tweets for things that our target audience are saying</em></strong>  in a conversational tweet  <em>right now</em>.</p>
<p>See below for detail.</p>
<h4 id="search-nuances">Search Nuances</h4>
<p>We would not search for something like “HR.” Instead, we would search for something an HR person would say, like “send your resume.”</p>
<p>Examples Searches / Things HR People Say</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22send%20your%20resume%22">send your resume</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22great%20place%20to%20work%22">great place to work</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22join%20our%20mission%22">join our mission</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The good thing about this search strategy is it means we find currently active users talking about our niche, right now. Also, we get less bots in the results by searching with conversational terms.</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>On the face of it, it might seem like a good idea to search people’s bios for keywords like HR. It isn’t! These search terms produce stale results and inactive users.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-follow-compliment--thank">Step #4: Follow, Compliment &amp; Thank</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following:</strong>  The main thing we need to worry about is to not follow too many people per day.</li>
<li><strong>Interactions:</strong>  We just need to be genuine.</li>
<li><strong>Thanks:</strong>  Send your “thanks for following” message to new followers</li>
</ul>
<p>See below for detail.</p>
<h4 id="following---do-this">Following - Do this!</h4>
<p>Expectations</p>
<ul>
<li>For every 100 people you follow, you should expect to get 3-5 people signing up to your email list.</li>
<li>For every 10-20 people that join your list you should expect 50% to join your Slack</li>
<li>For every 10 that join your Slack you should expect to get 1-2 super seeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by following just a small amount per day, for example 25, then work your way up to 100 people per day to begin with, particularly when you have less than 2,000 followers.</p>
<p>Larger accounts can follow more people without a problem. However, Twitter has a hard limit of 1,000 follows per day.</p>
<p>Here is what Twitter has to say on the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every account can follow 5,000 accounts total. Once you’ve followed 5,000 accounts, there are limits to the number of additional accounts you can follow. This number is different for each account and is based on your ratio of followers to following; this ratio is not published. Follow limits cannot be lifted by Twitter and everyone is subject to limits, even high profile and API accounts.</li>
<li>Every Twitter account is technically unable to follow more than 1,000 accounts per day, in addition to the account-based limits above. Please note that this is just a technical limit to prevent egregious abuse from spam accounts.</li>
<li>Accounts are also prohibited from aggressively following other accounts. Learn more about  <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-following-rules">Twitter’s following rules</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="interaction---do-this">Interaction - Do this!</h4>
<p>Expectations</p>
<ul>
<li>For every 20 interactions (with new REAL people) you should expect 5 of them to result in someone looking at your profile</li>
<li>For every 10 profile views you should expect 2-4 to join your mailinglist</li>
<li>For every 10-20 people that join your list you should expect 50% to join your Slack</li>
<li>For every 10 that join your Slack you should expect to get 1-2 super seeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a  <strong><em>key strategy</em></strong>  to to reply, retweet, comment, and compliment users. The main reason to do this is in the hope that those folks will look at our bio to learn more about us.</p>
<p>So in this case, it’s just best to be genuine. Say nice and interesting things to people, and the rest will take care of itself.</p>
<h4 id="thanks---do-this">Thanks - Do this!</h4>
<p>Expectations</p>
<ul>
<li>See “Following” expectations (above)</li>
</ul>
<p>Go to  <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/">https://twitter.com/</a><em>&lt;<em>you</em>&gt;</em>/followers</strong>  and send your thank you message to any new followers.</p>
<p>For best effect, repeat steps 3 &amp; 4 every day. Spend about 5-10 minutes on it. Pay careful attention to who you follow and try to avoid following bots!</p>
