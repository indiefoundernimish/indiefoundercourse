<p><em>Flux Capacitor - Back to the Future</em></p>
<h4 id="a-landing-page-in-flux">A Landing Page in Flux</h4>
<p>I love this quote by Sebastian Thrun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Few ideas work on the first try. Iteration is key to innovation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never has the concept of iterating an idea been truer than during the  <em>Vapor</em>  phase of our landing page. As a result, we’ll be updating its copy on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Updates should happen each time one of the following events occur:</p>
<p>Copy Change Events</p>
<ul>
<li>10+ people visit our landing page with no signups</li>
<li>We learn something game-changing from customer discussions</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, as our page moves from  <em>Vapor</em>  to  <em>Liquid</em>  to  <em>Solid</em>, we change the copy less often because we have more clarity about what customers want.</p>
<p><em>Notes</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it is possible to get it right on the first try! You’ll know if you have because for every 10 visitors to your page, over 60% will sign up.</li>
<li>There is no need for A/B testing frameworks at this point because we can easily measure outcomes using our own eyes.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="a-crash-course-in-marketing-copy">A Crash Course in Marketing Copy</h4>
<p>Before we get to examples of what to say on a landing page, here is a crash course in the essentials of marketing copy:</p>
<p>Headlines are Key</p>
<p>David Ogilvy, known as the father of advertising, said the following about headlines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write great headlines and you’ll have successfully invested 80% of your money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changing nothing but the headline can massively increase conversions. For this reason, consider the headline the most important component of your landing page.</p>
<p>Use Customer Language</p>
<p>Another classic quote from David Ogilvy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk to them in the language they use every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, pay special attention to the words customers use, and reflect those exact words and phrases back to them in your landing page copy.</p>
<p>This is especially true of things like acronyms and workplace slang they use every day.</p>
<p>The reason we do this is because it helps customers connect with what we are saying and resonates with them.</p>
<p>Highlight Benefits NOT Features</p>
<p>The main reason Apple dominated the early MP3 player market was because Steve Jobs understood customers don’t care about features; they want benefits.</p>
<p>In iPod ads, Apple didn’t say “iPod: 1GB of Storage.” Instead, they sold the benefit “iPod: 1,000 songs in your pocket.”</p>
<p>In an era when CDs were the smallest digital storage medium, this was a benefit people could understand and were blown away by.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/ipod-ad.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>To further expand on the idea of benefits over features, here are a few examples of what a feature vs. a benefit is:</p>
<p><strong>A Bed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Feature: Strong frame and soft mattress</li>
<li>Benefit: A great night’s sleep</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An Umbrella</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Feature: Nice wooden handle</li>
<li>Benefit: Easy to grip</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Diet Coke</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Feature: Low calorie soda</li>
<li>Benefit: Helps you look better</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Slack</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Feature: Chat platform for your staff</li>
<li>Benefit: Reduce email by 50%</li>
</ul>
<p>Write to Be Understood</p>
<p>Here is a great tweet from Jason Fried of 37 Signals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When writing marketing copy, read it out loud. Then ask yourself “Would I ever say it this way to someone if I was talking to them?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, just like Jason says, when you write your copy, read it aloud. Does it make sense to you? Does it roll off your tongue?</p>
<p>If not, then your customers will probably have a hard time understanding what you’ve written.</p>
<p>Use Short Paragraphs</p>
<p>Long paragraphs are dense and hard to scan. If you review a long paragraph, you can almost always find a place where you could break it up in to two paragraphs. This makes the information easier for the user to digest.</p>

<h4 id="example-vapor-landing-page-copy">Example Vapor Landing Page Copy</h4>
<p>It’s always easier to see how things work when you have a few examples. With that in mind, I’m going to grab a few random nuggets and write  <em>Vapor</em>  landing page copy for them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, for all of these examples, I’ve not spoken to any customers. I’m just making it up, in the same way you’ll have to for the first version of your landing page.</p>
<p>Where possible, I’ll integrate the language used in the nugget into the copy.</p>

<p><strong>Sell Tell</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>There are three ways to communicate on your landing page.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TELL</strong><br>
Tell them what it is.</li>
<li><strong>SELL</strong><br>
Sell it to them.</li>
<li><strong>SELL-TELL</strong><br>
Tell them what it is and sell it to them at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally we want to SELL-TELL. Here is an example of each type:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TELL</strong><br>
A tool to help you when prospecting for sales.</li>
<li><strong>SELL</strong><br>
Use our tool more deals.</li>
<li><strong>SELL-TELL</strong><br>
Become a Ninja Prospector. Win more deals.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>When I wrote these examples I vowed to use whatever the nugget shuffle button turned up. I won’t lie, thinking of copy for “App to track how much of an area you have seen” was not easy! But with a little mental effort, you can write  <em>Vapor</em>-style copy for just about  <em>any</em>  idea.</p>
