<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Why you should de-risk your chances of success by leveraging “product/founder fit.”</li>
</ul>

<p>A good friend of mine works as Entrepreneur in Residence for a well-known fund. As you can imagine, he is pitched by many founders. He has told me that something he regularly finds himself thinking is “This is a great idea, but it’s the wrong founder.”</p>
<p>It saddens me that so many founders get hooked on an idea and ignore fundamental truths about themselves. Truths that are often holding up a bright neon sign saying, “No! Don’t do that!”</p>
<p>At first, the idea of choosing a project that is “right for you” seems like a quaint idea, something nice to have, almost esoteric. Certainly not a fundamental business strategy. But, if you dig deeper, you might be surprised to discover it is a powerful strategy for success.</p>
<p>When I say product/founder fit, I’m not just talking about something you like. I’m also talking about all the different ways that a project might fit you. For example, you have the correct temperament, you have the correct experience, you have the correct capability and yes, you really like it.</p>
<p>Product/founder fit simply asks one question:</p>
<h4 id="is-this-idea-right-for-you">Is THIS idea right for YOU?</h4>
<p>Which can be broken down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have the time and capability?</li>
<li>Can you market and sell it?</li>
<li>Do you have the correct temperament?</li>
<li>Do you have the correct experience?</li>
<li>Do you really like it?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-productfounder-fit-strategy">The Product/Founder Fit Strategy</h4>
<p>For something to be a strategy, it needs to be something you can get better at. In just the same way you might improve your golf swing with practice, you should be able to improve your skill at finding projects with a good product/founder fit with practice.</p>
<p>Can this be done? Yes.</p>
<p>After examining 3,000 business ideas and thinking about each of them through the lens of my personal product/founder fit, I know just how far one can go with this.</p>
<p>The simple fact is, the more that gels between me and an idea (experience, capability, interest, etc.), the lower my risk of failure is.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to ideas  <em>after they’ve been validated</em>. For example, I have a much higher chance of success with a perfect-for-me validated idea than I do with a random validated idea.</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>If our strategy is to validate ideas we think are cool, vs. validate ideas that really suit us, we are leaving a lot of de-risk goodness on the table.</p>
<p><em>Example of a Bad Fit</em></p>
<p>After the win of selling Pluggio, I needed a new side project to work on. Uber for “x” (like Uber for groceries, Uber for dog walking, etc.) was all the rage. So, I spent a long time thinking about what kind of Uber for “x” I could build.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/lyte.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I really liked the idea of Uber for coffee and snacks. So, I worked nine months nights and weekends to build a beautiful app &amp; dispatch platform called Lyte.</p>
<p>When I finished building it, I launched it, hired some couriers, did some local marketing. Orders quickly started coming in. The business was officially launched and making money.</p>
<p>There was just one problem… I did not like it.</p>
<p>Foolishly I did not anticipate the daytime operation requirements of the business. I was so enamored with the idea of building Uber for “x” that I forgot to look at the fundamental truths about my life.</p>
<p>I had a full time job, a wife, a kid, and very limited hours. Almost zero hours during the regular working day.</p>
<p>But, even worse than all of that - the first time I used my own service to order a cup of coffee. When my courier delivered it to me, I felt a strange feeling of awkwardness and wondered why I had not just gone out and grabbed it for myself!</p>
<p>I might have been able to battle through all the other issues, but there was no way I could spend 3-5 years building a business that made me feel awkward, no matter how big the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lyte was a cool idea.</li>
<li>I had the technical capability to build it and I did.</li>
<li>I had the design capability to brand it.</li>
<li>I had the execution capability to launch and market it.</li>
<li>It worked! I made sales! People ordered!</li>
<li>Couriers delivered coffee to customers!</li>
<li>It was a real business!</li>
</ul>
<p>There was one core problem…</p>
<p><strong>It was a bad product/founder fit for me.</strong></p>
<p>So, after realizing this, I dropped it and moved on.</p>
<p>My next project was Nugget.</p>
