<p><em>Let Go</em></p>
<p>Before we begin this discussion…</p>
<p>It’s time to be the Buddha. Take a step back. Take a deep breath. Let go of your attachment to  <em>this</em>  idea.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/falling.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another deep breath. Doesn’t that feel better? Ok, now let’s continue.</p>
<h3 id="ego">Ego</h3>
<p>Sometimes our ego takes over and we get stuck. We want to prove to ourselves and others that we can climb a specific mountain.</p>
<p>I see this effect  <em>a lot</em>  with startup founders. They get stuck on one idea and give it way more time than they should. They seem to take pride in battling the adversity that the idea brings their way.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>There are so many possible ways we can get our first entrepreneurial notch our belt. So why choose the hardest path?</p>
<p>The beauty of #FailFast is it gives us a chance to test multiple ideas quickly and see if one of them just “works” for us.</p>
<p>That may sound like a fru-fru idea, but it’s really not. There are any number of reasons why one idea might work much better for us than others.</p>
<p>Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong>  It might just be the exact right time for us to do this idea</li>
<li><strong>Luck:</strong>  Something might happen that makes this idea work better</li>
<li><strong>Personality:</strong>  We might have the perfect personality for this market</li>
<li><strong>Access:</strong>  We might have easy access to customers in this market</li>
<li><strong>Enthusiasm:</strong>  We might have discovered a niche with very enthusiastic customers</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m pretty sure that I hit one or two of those with Pluggio.</p>
<p>In other words, the  <em>main</em>  benefit of #FailFast is that we get more turns at bat, which will give us more chances to find an  <strong>Idea with Benefits</strong>.</p>
<p>In other words: Hyper Iteration.</p>
<h3 id="when-should-i-failfast">When Should I #FailFast?</h3>
<p>#FailFast is an art, not a science. It’s a rather delicate balance between ducking out too soon and  <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/">sunk cost fallacy</a>.</p>
<p>The main thing to keep in mind is that #FailFast is  <em>way</em>  more effective than #FailSlow and keeps up your momentum.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you’ll need to be the judge of when to move on by using the following indicators to gut check how you are feeling.</p>
<p>Signs That Signal You Should Move On</p>
<ul>
<li>Inability to build a seed group in that niche</li>
<li>Lack of interest from your seed group</li>
<li>Seed group says they like the idea but wouldn’t pay anything for it</li>
<li>You decide  <em>you</em>  do not like the idea, even if your seed group does</li>
<li>The only way to make the seed group happy is for you to build a large, complex product (not a little snowball)</li>
</ul>
<p>Signs That Signal You Should Stay</p>
<ul>
<li>Seed Group is giving good feedback</li>
<li>Seed Group is willing to pay</li>
<li>You still like the idea after seeing it evolve during validation</li>
<li>If feedback from the group is mixed, it’s a sign to stay and keep growing the group until you’ve got more opinions to base your decision on</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in doubt, use #CircleBack rather than #FailFast. That way, you can get the full measure of multiple ideas in a short amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="the-circleback-trick">The #CircleBack Trick</h3>
<p>If we find the idea of failure very difficult to swallow, there is a trick we can use. Rather than think about failing, we can think about temporarily stopping and circling back at a later point.</p>
<p>I’ve used this trick  <em>a lot</em>  and now I have over 100 projects to #CircleBack to at some point! The odds of my actually returning to most of them are slim, but it can be easier to think of a project as “on hold” than as “a failure.”</p>
