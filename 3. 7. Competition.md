<p>Something that comes up a lot during my conversations with founders is Competition,  <em>with a capital C</em>.</p>
<p>Often times, they steer clear of really interesting projects because they feel there is too much competition in that market. It’s a common cognitive bias because that’s how we’re taught to think about competition in the “normal” business world.</p>
<p>However, in my not-so-humble opinion, if you are a building a self-funded SaaS app as a side project, competition doesn’t matter… until it does.</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>This is a nuanced subject. You should remember touching on it in the Stage 2 lesson about  <a href="https://nugget.one/academy/stage/2/step/6">cloning and tweaking existing products</a>. It can get messy, but if we break it down, you’ll see what I mean.</p>
<h4 id="competition-vectors">Competition Vectors</h4>
<p>There are three core vectors you should consider when trying to determine if competition should deter you from pursuing a side project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your revenue goal</li>
<li>Your market size</li>
<li>Your price points</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve listed a number of scenarios below to show how this works.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-1">Scenario #1</h4>
<p>Let’s say you have a revenue goal of $20k/month, there are 10 million possible customers in your market, the market is B2B, the competition is charging at least $50/month per customer, and you can build a competing product in three months, or less as a solo developer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your revenue goal: $20k/month</li>
<li>Your market size: 10 million, B2B</li>
<li>Your price point: ~$50/month</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>In this scenario, competition does not matter.</em></strong></p>
<p>In fact, it helps.</p>
<p>Based on this data, you know you can charge $50/month or more. Which, in turn, means you only need to get 400 customers to hit your revenue target. If you hack away at a good competing product and read up about various marketing techniques, you will be able to get 400 customers out of 10 million people.</p>
<p>Example markets: CRMs, Project Management Tools, Lead Gen Tools, etc.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-2">Scenario #2</h4>
<p>You have a revenue goal of $5k/month, there are 100 million possible customers in your market, the market is prosumer, the competition is charging $10/month, and you can build a competing product in three months, or less as a solo developer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your revenue goal: $5k/month</li>
<li>Your market size: 100 million, prosumer</li>
<li>Your price point: ~$10/month</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Again, competition does not matter.</em></strong></p>
<p>As before, it helps.</p>
<p>Based on this data you know you need 500 customers at $10/month. With diligent marketing efforts, you can get to 500 customers out of 100 million people.</p>
<p>Example markets: Social Media Tools, Work Productivity Tools, Website Builders, etc.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-3">Scenario #3</h4>
<p>You have a revenue goal of $100k a month, there are 10,000 possible customers in your market, the market is B2B, the competition is charging $50/month.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your revenue goal: $100k/month</li>
<li>Your market size: 10,000, B2B</li>
<li>Your price point: ~$50/month</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>In this scenario, competition DOES matter.</em></strong></p>
<p>Because you would need a rather large 20% of the market to hit your revenue goals. You would most likely need to become the category leader in this market.</p>
<p>Example markets: Tools for SaaS companies, Management app for CrossFit gyms, etc.</p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>An alternative approach you might try is to quadruple the price of your product to $200/month. Now you only need 500 customers.</p>
<p>This might work because all markets have a small slice of users at the top who will pay top dollar, and a large wedge of users at the bottom who will pay zero.</p>
<p>The gamble is, will 5% of this market pay 4x more than the current offerings, and can you find and convert those customers?</p>
<p>Either way, in this scenario it would be foolish to ignore the competition.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-4">Scenario #4</h4>
<p>You want to build a billion-dollar startup with a partner, and get VC funding to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your revenue goal: $$</li>
<li>Your market size: ?</li>
<li>Your price point: ?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>In this scenario, competition DOES matter.</em></strong></p>
<p>Even without clear metrics on market size or price point, we can already tell that in this case, competition does matter. Because Angels and VCs will need to feel confident in your ability to understand and navigate the competition.</p>
<p>Your product will need to be differentiated and/or very well executed. If you don’t have any good answers about how you’re going to defeat the competition, you will not be able to raise any money.</p>
<p>Example markets: On-demand mobile apps, marketplaces, social networks.</p>
<h4 id="scenario-5">Scenario #5</h4>
<p>Your market is so niche, there may be only 1000 customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your revenue goal: ?</li>
<li>Your market size: 1000</li>
<li>Your price point: ?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>In this scenario, competition DOES matter.</em></strong></p>
<p>Again, even without all the information on revenue goal or price point, in this case, competition does matter. It would not be optimal to compete against a well-established competitor in a very niche market.</p>
<p>Example market: Software to tweak Amiga 500 circuit board design</p>
<h2 id="why-competition-doesnt-matter-for-most-side-projects">Why Competition Doesn’t Matter for Most Side Projects</h2>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nugget.one/academy/lion.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed some of the nuances, let’s double-down on examples 1 &amp; 2 and see more reasons why competition doesn’t matter for most side projects:</p>
<h4 id="reason-1-customer-service">Reason #1: Customer Service</h4>
<p>If you build up a rapport with your customers by serving them well, you will get a solid customer base.</p>
<p>The main driver for my success with Pluggio was that customers liked how I treated them. Often times this was why they stuck with me rather than going to Hootsuite.</p>
<p>As a result, I was able to build a great marketing site with in-depth case studies and customer testimonials.</p>
<h4 id="reason-2-people-have-different-tastes">Reason #2: People Have Different Tastes</h4>
<p>That which your competitor considers being an effective UI will annoy the hell out of a percentage of their customers.</p>
<p>Every day, those folks will log in and think “damn, I wish they didn’t do it this way.” Then, one day, those people will find out about your app and be overjoyed.</p>
<h4 id="reason-3-its-less-risky">Reason #3: It’s Less Risky</h4>
<p>It helps to be in a market with competition. It means potential customers are already educated about the type of tool you’re building.</p>
<p>So now, rather than spend time educating people, you can spend time finding clever marketing angles and differentiators to siphon people from the competition to your product. It also enables you to “know” that people will pay money for what you have to offer.</p>
<h4 id="reason-4-its-been-done-before">Reason #4: It’s Been Done Before</h4>
<p>Facebook, Google, Slack, DuckDuckGo, Drip, the list could go on and on.</p>
<p>All of these companies moved into already saturated markets and made it work.</p>
<p>Maybe they had an awesome founder or team, maybe they had impeccable timing, maybe their pricing strategy was gold. Regardless of how they did it, they’ve proven that it’s doable.</p>
<h4 id="reason-5-market-segmentation">Reason #5: Market Segmentation</h4>
<p>With true differentiation, you can carve your own segment out of any market. An analogy I like to use is Photoshop layers. In this analogy, the market is a single picture in Photoshop, built out of multiple layers. The trick is to make sure you are not on the same layer as anyone else. In many ways, this type of segmentation is like having no competition at all.</p>
<p>Consider Drip - it sits within the competitive ecosystem of email-as-a-service providers, but it still exists on a different layer than any other service in that market. No wonder it worked out!</p>
<p>In short, don’t let competition alone turn you off of an idea. When the factors of revenue goals, market, and price point don’t align, it can be a deal-breaker.</p>
<p>But when those factors do align, competition can work to your advantage. You may find there’s room for more than one product fish in the market sea!</p>
