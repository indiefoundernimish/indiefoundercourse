<p><em>In this lesson, you’ll learn:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Four mental models, focused on simplicity, that can supercharge everything you do.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the previous lesson, we discussed bad advice. Our goal was to help you avoid key potholes that can waste your time.</p>
<p>In this lesson, we’re taking the reverse strategy. We’ll share with you a set of mental models that we’ve used for every success we’ve experienced as entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>A mental model is an explanation of how something works. It is a concept, framework, or worldview that you carry around in your mind. Mental models guide your perception and behavior. They are the thinking tools that you use to understand life, make decisions, and solve problems.</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional mental models will be sprinkled throughout the later stages</em></strong>, but we wanted you to get started thinking about these. In this lesson, we’ll take a quick look at four mental models focused around the themes of smallness and simplicity.</p>

<h3 id="think-small">#1: Think Small</h3>
<p>When it comes to startups,  <strong><em>nothing is more powerful than thinking small</em></strong>. Small steps. Small goals. Small wins. Small is easy. Small is achievable. BIG is made up of lots of smalls.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself thinking big, try to reign in your big vision for now,  <strong><em>focus only on your next small achievable goal</em></strong>. After you achieve it, repeat that process.</p>
<p>You can still hold onto your big vision, but rather than focus on it, just use it as your distant north star.</p>
<p>You’ll be amazed at how this subtle shift in operating will get you moving forward and start notching up genuine wins.</p>

<h3 id="keep-it-simple-stupid">#2: Keep It Simple, Stupid</h3>
<p><strong><em>Try to simplify each thing you do. It will dramatically improve your outcomes.</em></strong>  Complexity creates surface area. Just like a large parachute will slow down a drag racer, complexity will slow down everything that it touches. Here are some common examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI:</strong>  A complex UI will cause user fatigue and will ultimately lead to increased churn and/or lower conversion rates.</li>
<li><strong>Product Idea:</strong>  Just about every part of your business becomes harder if the foundational idea is not simple. Sales, demos, coding, investment, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Business Model:</strong>  A complex business model, such as building an app marketplace, is the definition of quicksand. Don’t do it!</li>
<li><strong>Legal Agreements:</strong>  Complex legal agreements slow everything down and cost a lot of money.</li>
<li><strong>Writing:</strong>  Small simple paragraphs = easy to read.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hyper-iteration">#3: Hyper Iteration</h3>
<p>We first heard about hyper iteration (our name for it) in a story about Paul MacCready, a guy who built the first human-powered airplane.</p>
<p>He achieved this goal by changing how he attacked the problem. Rather than focusing on the larger goal, he built a machine that enabled him to test new human-powered flight theories on a daily basis. This enabled him to run hundreds of tests. The other teams trying to achieve this goal took 6-12 months for each iteration.</p>
<p>Your entire startup journey will consist of a loop of asking one single question:</p>
<p>If we do this, will it work?</p>
<p>You will be asking that question over and over again:</p>
<p>Will this new feature help me get more customers? Will advertising on Facebook help me make more sales? Etc. The faster you can iterate each answer to that question, the faster you will achieve success.</p>
<p>A realized idea represents “a mountain of reality”. The closer it is to reality, the harder it is to change any aspect of it. As an idea becomes more realized the more it descends through multiple “layers”.</p>

<li>A thought in the brain</li>
<li>A note on a napkin</li>
<li>A bullet point list</li>
<li>A discussion with someone</li>
<li>A discussion with a group</li>
<li>A light specification</li>
<li>A wireframe mockup</li>
<li>A hifi mockup</li>
<li>A database schema</li>
<li>An API endpoint</li>
<li>Some HTML &amp; CSS</li>
<li>Some javascript</li>
<li>A deployment to a test server</li>
<li>A QA developer testing it</li>
<li>A push to production</li>
</ol>
<p>We should double down on hyper iterating in layers 1-5 and try to get as close to the truth as possible before we move to the other slower layers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/">agile development process</a> is a perfect example of hyper iteration. Instead of spending months building lengthy specification documents, development teams can hit the ground running and start to build software from day one.</p>

<h3 id="recursive-quality-factor">#4: Recursive Quality Factor</h3>
<p>In the early days of  <a href="http://techzinglive.com/">the podcast</a>, we discussed a research paper that reviewed the quality of restaurants. The paper asserted  <strong><em>you can guess the quality of a whole restaurant by looking at any individual part of it</em></strong>.</p>
<p>For example, if the restaurant had high quality silverware, then most likely other aspects would be high quality, such as food, bathrooms, kitchen, etc.</p>
<p>I’ve found this idea very powerful. It can be applied to just about anything. It’s especially useful if you need to make speedy qualitative analysis of things like 3rd party providers, tools, etc.</p>
<p>I also use RQF as a guiding principle for any product I create. First impressions count, no matter where in the product stack they occur.</p>
<p><strong><em>In other words, it might not be such a dumb idea to sweat the details</em></strong>. Most people don’t care about all the details. Problem is, you don’t know what people <em>will</em> care about. That’s why attention to detail is so important.</p>
