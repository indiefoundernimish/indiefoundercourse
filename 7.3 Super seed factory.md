<ul>
<li>How to set up Slack as a highly effective way to create and nurture Super Seeds.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="super-seed-factory">Super Seed Factory</h3>
<p>Setting up a Slack group for Nugget was not in the original game plan. It was more of an afterthought. In fact, I almost didn’t set it up for fear of having too many platforms.</p>
<p>Well, turns out it was one of the best thing I’ve ever done. I accidentally created a Super Seed factory.</p>
<p>I could never have imagined how many deep and meaningful conversations with customers would take place on Slack. Conversations that ultimately lead to this course right here.</p>
<p>Due to its asynchronous nature, Slack enables you to nurture multiple strong relationships at your convenience.</p>
<p><strong><em>If anything could be called a Super Seed factory, it’s a private Slack group that is filled with your customers and prospects!</em></strong></p>
<p>That is why I consider it mandatory for you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a Slack focus group</li>
<li>Plug it in to your landing page and email list</li>
<li>Ask everyone you talk to to join it</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Having customers on tap, to ask questions and to talk to any time you want to, is a kick in the ass and a game changer.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Note</em></p>
<p>If you’re worried your market won’t know or understand Slack… Consider that my mum, who is 70 and terrible at tech, is a member of 7 Slack groups!</p>
<p>In other words, I think it has reached an acceptable tipping point.</p>
<h3 id="slack-benefits">Slack Benefits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Being asynchronous makes Slack much easier for your customers to maintain a dialog with you (i.e. no meeting scheduling required).</li>
<li>Slack enables you to easily set up multiple private groups of discussion that are hidden from the rest of the workspace. This is especially useful if you would like to create a private chat between you and 5-10 Super Seeds to focus on a specific validation hypothesis, for example.</li>
<li>Slack conversations are less likely to go dead in the same way that email conversations do, which makes Slack a great way to build ongoing relationships.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="customer-interviews-with-slack">Customer Interviews with Slack</h3>
<p>You’ll want to try to catch customers when they first create their account so you can have a quick chat with them to establish a rapport.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, but always be nice and courteous. Keep in mind they are doing you a favor!</p>
<p>With regard to interviews, you won’t be able to have the same level of in-depth interview on Slack as you can with a face-to-face meeting.</p>
<p>Before you start asking questions, you should always say something like:</p>
<p><strong>Warm Up Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have time for a quick question?</li>
<li>Do you mind if I ask a few quick questions? I’m trying to see if my idea is any good and would really appreciate your insight!</li>
<li>Continuing from our last discussion, I had a few more quick questions - mind if I ask them now?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then try to work the following questions into your on ongoing conversations:</p>
<p><strong>Slack Customer Development Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What is your process to do  <em>&lt;<em>thing in question</em>&gt;</em>?</li>
<li>What is the main problem you face when you’re doing  <em>&lt;<em>process in question</em>&gt;</em>?</li>
<li>What is the biggest pain point as a result of  <em>&lt;<em>problem in question</em>&gt;</em>?</li>
<li>If you could wave a magic wand to solve your problems related to  <em>&lt;<em>problem in question</em>&gt;</em>, what software would pop into existence? How would it make things better?</li>
<li>What solutions have you tried to solve  <em>&lt;<em>problem in question</em>&gt;</em>? Where did they fail?</li>
<li>Do you think other people have the same problem we’re talking about here?</li>
<li>Does a solution like  <em>&lt;<em>your solution</em>&gt;</em>  sound like something people might pay for?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have a fairly defined product idea and your landing page is at  <em>Liquid</em>  or  <em>Solid</em>, you can start to explore price:</p>
<p><strong>Slack Price Discovery Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How helpful would  <em>&lt;<em>your solution</em>&gt;</em>  be for you vs. what you have to do now?</li>
<li>What would be the maximum price for  <em>&lt;<em>your solution</em>&gt;</em>  that seems too cheap, and you could not take it seriously?</li>
<li>What would be the minimum price for  <em>&lt;<em>your solution</em>&gt;</em>  that would seem trustable?</li>
<li>What would be the maximum price for  <em>&lt;<em>your solution</em>&gt;</em>  that would still feel like good value?</li>
</ul>
<p>Always ask that “How helpful” question first so they are seeing the value in your product before they throw out any numbers.</p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t ask  <strong><em>all</em></strong>  these questions during one single Slack discussion!</li>
<li>Try to work them in to a few chat sessions over a few days.</li>
<li>Generally  <strong><em>limit each chat session to 10 minutes or less</em></strong>  (this will minimize chat fatigue for your customer).</li>
<li>Riff naturally off the things your customer says to create well rounded, full conversations.</li>
<li>The final action of Stage 7 is to update your landing page from  <em>Vapor</em>  to  <em>Liquid</em>, so these conversations are just around the bend! Don’t jump into them too soon, but don’t feel that you need to wait to the last minute to start discussing price. We’ll take a closer look at this in Stage 9.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setting-up-slack">Setting up Slack</h3>
<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is come up with a workspace name for your Slack group.</p>
<p>I suggest:</p>
<p><em>&lt;<em>your-brand</em>&gt;</em>-focus-group</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://happy-focus-group.slack.com">https://happy-focus-group.slack.com</a></p>
<p>To get started, read:</p>
<p><a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206845317-Create-a-Slack-workspace">Slack’s Documentation</a></p>
<p><em>Important</em></p>
<p>We’ll show you exactly how to integrate Slack with your landing page, step-by-step, in the next action (Stage 7, Step 4).</p>
